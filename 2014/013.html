<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 





<p class="body">Heavy metals in water have been a major
preoccupation for researchers for many years due to their toxicity towards
aquatic life, human beings and environment [1]. This is because they do not
biodegrade unlike organic pollutants, making their presence in industrial
effluents and drinking water a public health concern [2]. </p>

<p class="body">Despite their poisonous nature the heavy
metals are used in various ways. Lead is an essential element in the
manufacture of bullets, pipes, lead-acid accumulators and welding. Lead in the
environment has negative impacts which include severe damage to the kidney,
nervous system, reproductive system liver and brain [3, 4]. Therefore it must
be removed from the water and waste waters in order to safeguard human and
environmental health [5]. </p>

<p class="body">The conventional removal methods for lead
such as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, electrochemical deposition
solvent extraction are not only expensive but they also generate secondary
sludge which at times is more difficult to treat [6]. The methods are also
ineffective in removal of heavy metals at low concentrations of &lt; 100 mg L<sup>-1
</sup>[7]. Due to the stringent environmental regulations on the minimum
acceptable amounts of Pb (II) ions in drinking water, irrigation water and
industrial effluents, there is need to come up with novel cost effective
technologies for Pb (II) ions removal.</p>

<p class="body">Previously several materials have been
investigated for removal of heavy metals from water and waste waters. This
includes heartwood
powder of <i>Areca catechu </i>[8, 9, 10, 11]< </p>

<p class="body">The objective of this study was to
investigate the application of <i>E. crasippes</i> an invasive weed species
which has potential to successfully colonize, spread, and subsequently displace
vegetation and disrupt ecosystems [12] as an adsorbent for Pb (II) ions removal
from aqueous solutions.</p>

<p class="body">The effects of several physico-chemical
parameters such as pH, adsorbent dosage, contact time, initial metal ion
concentration and temperature that affect adsorption were investigated.
Equilibrium isotherm models and kinetic models were applied to the data
obtained for a better understanding of the adsorption process. </p>

<h4>2. Materials and Methods</h4>

<p class="subhead">1.1. Biomass Preparation</p>

<p class="body">E. crassipes plants were harvested from Winam Gulf,
Kisumu bay at Kisat and Hippo point of L. Victoria, Kenya. The collected
biomass was washed several times with tap water to remove adhering dirt. The
washed biomass was then cut into roots, shoots and stems and the parts dried
separately for 2 week. The dried brown plant biomass were then transported to
the University of Nairobi laboratories were they were further dried and later
ground and sieved to various particle sizes( &lt;75&micro;m, &gt;75&lt; 300 &micro;m,
&gt;300&lt; 425 &micro;m and &gt; 425 &micro;m). The material was washed again using
distilled water, then dried in an oven for 48 hours at 70&deg;C then stored in
plastic containers awaiting biosorption experiments. Preliminary studies
indicated that though there was no big difference in the adsorption rates of
the various parts the roots were better. Therefore roots were used in this
adsorption experiments.</p>

<p class="subhead">1.2. Chemicals</p>

<p class="body">All chemicals used in the present work
were of analytical grade. The stock solution of Pb<sup>2+</sup> ions was
prepared in 1.0 g L<sup>-1</sup> concentration using 1.6066 g Pb(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>
(Sigma Aldrich) then diluted to appropriate concentrations .The pH of the
solutions was adjusted using 0.1 mol L<sup>-1</sup> HCl and 0.05 mol L<sup>-1</sup>
NaOH solutions.</p>

<p class="subhead">1.3. Analysis of Metal Ions</p>

<p class="body">The concentration of Pb (II) ions in the
biosorption media was determined using Atomic absorption Spectrophotometer
(Varian Spectr AA), equipped with air acetylene burner. The hollow cathode lamp
was operating at 8 mA. Analytical wavelength was set at 283.3 nm.</p>

<p class="subhead">1.4. Biosorption Experiments</p>

<p class="body">Biosorption experiments were conducted at
room temperature (26 &deg;C) by agitating a given mass of biosorbent with 20 mL of
metal ions solution of desired concentration in 100 ml polypropylene containers
using an orbital shaker at a speed of 200 rpm for 20 min except for contact
time experiments. The effect of solution pH on equilibrium biosorption of metal
ions was investigated under similar experimental conditions between 2.0 and
7.0. After the adsorbate has had the desired contact time of interaction with
the adsorbent, the samples were filtered using Whatman no. 42 filter paper and
the residual concentration analyzed using CTA- 2000 AAS. However experiments
involving effect of contact time used filter paper no 2. For studies on effect
of temperature the adsorption studies were carried out at 25, 30, 40, 50, 60
and 70 &deg;C. </p>

<p class="body">The amount of biosorption (q) was
calculated by using the equation below.</p>

are the initial and final metal ion concentrations (mg L<sup>-1</sup>)
respectively. <b>V</b> is the volume of the solution (L) and <b>m</b> is the
amount of biosorbent used (g).</p>

<h4>3. Results and Discussion</h4>

<p class="subhead">3.1. Effect of pH on Metal Biosorption</p>

<p class="body">Hydrogen ion concentration is one of the
important factors that influence the adsorption behavior of metal ions in
aqueous solutions. It affects the solubility of metal ions in solution,
replaces some of the positive ions found in active sites and affects the degree
of ionization of the adsorbate during the process of biosorption. This is
because it affects solution chemistry and also the speciation of the metal
ions. The effect of initial pH on biosorption of Pb (II) ions onto <i>E.crasippes</i>
was evaluated in the pH range of 2.0 to 7.0. Studies in pH range above 7.0 were
not attempted as there is precipitation of lead (II) hydroxides. From the Figure
1.</p>

<figure>
<img src="013_files/image003.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 1. Effect of pH on % adsorption of Pb (II) ions</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">From Figure 1 it could be seen that Pb
(II) ions adsorption increased as the pH increased. At low pH values, protons
occupy the biosorption sites on the biosorbent surface and therefore less Pb
(II) ions can be adsorbed because of electrostatic repulsion between the metal
cations and the protons occupying the binding sites.</p>

<p class="body">When the pH was increased, the biosorbent
surface became more negatively charged and the biosorption of the metal cations
increased drastically until equilibrium was reached at pH 5.0 - 6.0. At pH of
&gt;6 .0 there is formation of hydroxylated complexes of the metal ions and
these complexes compete with the metal cations for the adsorption sites hence a
reduction in the effective metal cations removal. Therefore adsorption
experiments at pH above this were not considered. </p>


<p class="subhead">3.2. Effect of Adsorbent Dosage</p>

<p class="body">The number of available binding sites and
exchanging ions for the biosorption depends upon the amount of biosorbent in
the biosorption system. This is attributed to the fact that it determines the
number of binding sites available to remove the metal ions at a given
concentration. The dosage also determines the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent
with an increase in mass reducing the adsorption capacity as the mass increase
from 0.125 g to 2.5 g per 20 mL of adsorbate. The effect of biomass dosage on
adsorption of Pb (II) ions is indicated in Figure 2.</p>

<figure>
<img src="013_files/image004.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 2. Effect of weight and particle size of E.crassipes on adsorption of 10 mg/L
Pb (II) ions</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">An increase in the percentage adsorption
is attributed to an increase in the number of binding sites for the metal cations.
Similar results were recorded in the literature for other adsorbents. However
the mass could not be increased infinitely as at some point all the solution is
sequestered leaving no residual solution for concentration determination.</p>

<p class="subhead">3.3. Effect of Initial Metal Concentration.</p>

<p class="body">The initial concentration remarkably
affected the uptake of Pb (II) ions in solution. The efficiency of Pb (II) ions
adsorption by <i>E.crasippes</i> at different initial concentrations (20-600 mg
L<sup>-1</sup>) was investigated as shown in Figure 3.</p>

<figure>
<img src="013_files/image005.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 3. Effect of initial concentration of Pb (II) ions on adsorption</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="body">At a lower concentration, the adsorption
sites take up the available Pb (II) ions much quickly due to less competition
among the metal ions for the available binding sites which are fixed in this
case. However, as the concentration increases the competition for the limited
binding sites sets in as the binding sites become saturated.</p>


<p class="subhead">3.4. Effect of Contact Time</p>

<p class="body">Contact time is an important parameter
for any successful use of the biosorbents for practical purposes. Effect of contact
time on adsorption of Pb (II) ions was investigated keeping the biomass in
contact with the metal ion solution for different time periods between 0 to 60
minutes. It was noted that as adsorption proceeds, the sorbent reaches
saturation state, at this point the sorbed solute tends to desorb back into
solution (Figure 4).</p>

<figure>
<img src="013_files/image006.jpg" class="article-img">

<figcaption>
Figure 4. Effect of
contact time on adsorption of Pb (II) ions</figcaption>
</figure>


<p class="body">Eventually, the rate of adsorption and
desorption are equal at equilibrium. When the system attains equilibrium, no
further net adsorption occurs. The time taken to attain equilibrium is very
important for process optimization. The rate of adsorption is very fast at
first and over 95 % of total biosorption of Pb (II) ions occurs in the first 5
minutes and thereafter it proceeds at a slower rate and finally no further
significant adsorption is noted beyond 20 minutes of contact time. The very
fast adsorption makes the material suitable for continuous flow water treatment
systems.</p>

<p class="subhead">3.5. Effect of Temperature</p>

<p class="body">Temperature of the medium affects the removal efficiency of
pollutants in aqueous solutions. This is because a change in temperature in
turn affects the solubility of pollutants and also the kinetic energy of the
adsorbing ions. Therefore the effect of temperature on adsorption of Pb (II)
ions was investigated.</p>

<p class="body">The results obtained indicated that the % adsorption
increases with increase in temperature up to 40 &deg;C, after that any increase in
temperature is accompanied by a reduction in % adsorption. This can be
attributed to the fact that with increase in temperature of the solution, the
attractive forces between the biomass surface and Pb (II) ions are weakened
thus decreasing the sorption efficiency. This could be due to increase in the
tendency for the Pb (II) ions to escape from the solid phase of the biosorbent
to the liquid phase with increase in temperature. When the kinetic energy of
particles is increased the rate of desorption is faster than the adsorption
rate hence decreased adsorption efficiency.</p>


<p class="subhead">3.6. Adsorption kinetics</p>

<p class="body">Kinetic study provides useful information
about the mechanism of adsorption and subsequently investigation of the
controlling mechanism of biosorption as either mass transfer or chemisorption.
This helps in obtaining the optimum operating conditions for industrial-scale
batch processes.</p>

<p class="body">A good correlation of the kinetic data explains the
biosorption mechanism of the metal ion on the solid phase. In order to evaluate
the kinetic mechanism that controls the biosorption process, the
pseudo-first-order models were applied for biosorption of Pb (II) ions on the
biosorbent.</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>3.6.1.Pseudo-first-order Kinetics</i></p>

<p class="body">The Lagergren pseudo- first-order rate
model is represented by the equation [13]:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="013_files/image007.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(03)</div>
</div>



<p class="body">Where <img src="013_files/image008.png"> and <img src="013_files/image009.png">are the amounts of metal adsorbed (mg g<sup>-1</sup>)
at equilibrium and at time t respectively, and <img src="013_files/image010.png">is
the rate constant of pseudo-first-order biosorption (min <sup>-1</sup>). The <img src="013_files/image008.png">and rate constant were calculated from the
slope and intercept of plot of log (q<sub>e</sub>- q<sub>t</sub>) against time
t.</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>3.6.2. Pseudo-second-order Kinetics</i></p>

<p class="body">The pseudo-second-order equation
assumes that the rate limiting step might be due to chemical adsorption.
According to this model metal cations can bind to two binding sites on the
adsorbent surface. The equation can be expressed as [14]:</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="013_files/image011.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(04)</div>
</div>

<p class="body">Where k<sub>2</sub> is the rate constant of the
pseudo-second- order adsorption (g mg<sup>-1</sup>min<sup>-1</sup> ). If the
adsorption kinetics obeys the pseudo-second-order model, a linear plot of <i>t/q<sub>t</sub></i>
versus <i>t</i> can be observed as shown in Figure 5.</p>

<p class="subhead">3.7. Biosorption Isotherms</p>

<p class="body">For optimization of the biosorption process design , its
imperative to obtain the appropriate correlation for the equilibrium data.Biosorption
isotherms describe how adsorbate interacts with the biosorbent and the
residual metal ions in solution during the surface biosorption. The isotherms
also help in determination of adsorption capacityof the biosorbent for the
metal ions. The data on Pb (II) biosorption was fitted with the Langmuir and
Freundlich isotherms.</p>

<p class="subhead"><i>3.7.1. Langmuir Isotherm</i></p>

<p class="body">The Langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer coverage of the
adsorbate onto a homogeneous adsorbent surface and the biosorption of each
cation onto the surface has equal activation energy. According to the model the
number of adsorption sites are fixed and once a site is filled no further
adsorption will take place at that site. The surface becomes saturated. The
Linear form of the Langmuir isotherm can be expressed as [15, 18, 19] :</p>

<div class="equation">
<img src="013_files/image013.png" class="eqn">
<div class="eqn-number">(05)</div>
</div>


<p class="body">Where q<sub>max</sub> is the maximum adsorption capacity of
the adsorbent (mg g<sup>-1</sup>), and k<sub>L</sub> is the Langmuir biosorption
constant ( L mg <sup>-1</sup>) related to energy of adsorption.Values of
Langmuir parameters are calculated from the slope and intercept of linear plot
of C<sub>e</sub>/q<sub>e</sub> versus C<sub>e</sub> should be a straight line
with a slope of 1/q<sub>max</sub> and intercept of 1/q<sub>max</sub> k<sub>L</sub>
when the biosorption follows Langmuir equation.The non-linear and linearized plots
are represented in figure 6(a) and 6(b).</p>

<p class="body">Where k<sub>L</sub> is the Langmuir constant and C<sub>o</sub>
is the initial concentration of metal ions. The separation factor determines

<p class="subhead"><i>3.7.2. Freundlich Isotherm</p></i>

<p class="body">This is the earliest model for adsorption. The model
envisages heterogeneous adsorption where there is interaction between adsorbed
molecules on a surface. The Freundlich equation can be expressed as [15, 20]: </p>

<p class="body">where K<sub>F</sub>and 1/n are the Freundlich isotherm
constants related to bonding energy and adsorption intensity respectively. n
describes the heterogeneity of the adsorbent surface and its affinity for the
adsorbate [16]. <img src="013_files/image018.png">is the heterogeneity factor and
n is a measure of deviation from linearity of adsorption, higher value of n (or
a smaller value of <img src="013_files/image019.png">indicates a stronger bond between the
adsorbate and the adsorbent thus values of n larger than unity indicate a
strong bond which implies favourable adsorption [17]. If n is less than 1 ,
adsorption is a chemical process; if n is greater than 1 then adsorption is a
physical process [11]. If the equation applies then a plot of log q<sub>e</sub>
versus log C<sub>e</sub> will give a straight line of slope <img src="013_files/image019.png">and intercept as K<sub>F </sub>as

<h4>4.  Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">This study demonstrates that <i>E.crassipes</i> is a
promising adsorbent for the removal of Pb(II) ions from aqueous solutions. The
adsorption process was affected by various physico-chemical parameters such as
contact time, pH, initial concentration of the metal ions, shaking speed and
temperature.The kinetic study revealed that the adsorption data obeyed the
pseudo-second-order model better than the pseudo-first-order model given the
higher correlation coefficient(R<sup>2</sup>). It can therefore be concluded
that <i>E.crasippes</i> is an effective alternative biomass for the removal of Pb(II)
ions from wastewater because the material has a high adsorption capacity,
naturally and abundantly available at a low cost.Therefore it can be used in
the removal of heavy metal pollutants in water and waste water hence conserving
the environment.</p>
