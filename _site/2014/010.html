<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>   Urban lakes are typically smaller, shallower, and more exposed to human activities than natural lakes. Although the effects of harmful algal blooms (HABs) associated with eutrophication in urban lakes has become a growing concern for water resources management and environmental protection, studies focussing on this topic in relation to urban lakes are rare and knowledge of the ecological dynamics and effective management strategies for controlling eutrophication in urban lakes is lacking. This study applied an integrated three-dimensional hydrodynamics-ecological model for a small shallow tropical urban lake in Singapore and evaluated various management scenarios to control eutrophication in the lake. It is found that in-lake treatment techniques including artificial destratification, sediment manipulation and algaecide addition are either ineffective or possess environmental concerns; while watershed management strategies including hydraulic flushing and inflow nutrients reduction are more effective and have posed less environmental concerns. In this study, inflow phosphorus reduction was found to be the best strategy after evaluating the advantages and drawbacks of the management strategies studied. Runoff from the watershed exerts significant influence on urban lakes and thus an integrated water resources management at the watershed level is critical for the control of eutrophication.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Compared to natural
lakes, urban lakes are characterized by having a smaller size, shallower depth,
and larger ratio of watershed area to lake surface area [1]. A large proportion
of the urban lakes are man-made with the purposes of storing rainwater, water
supply or recreational uses [2]. Urban lakes tend to be more impacted by human
activities from receiving larger and poorer quality inflows from urban
watersheds. Thus, urban lakes receive higher nutrient loadings and have more
severe water quality issues such as eutrophication and reduced health [3, 4],
compared to natural lakes. With excessive addition of nutrients, especially
phosphorus, the water body can become eutrophic or even hypereutrophic with
undesired effects such as harmful algal blooms which would pose serious
environmental and management problems [5]. In recent decades, urbanization has
led to significant increases of nutrient enrichment levels in urban lakes and
as a result, there have been more occurrences of algal bloom events [6, 7].
While the water quality problems in urban lakes remains a challenge for watershed
and lake management, there are comparatively fewer studies focusing on urban
lakes and we have little knowledge of their ecological dynamics and management
strategies to effectively control eutrophication [1, 3].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In this paper, we
present a numerical modelling study for a small shallow urban lake located in a
tropical region using an integrated hydrodynamics-ecological model. After
calibrating the model, several management scenarios including watershed
management and in-lake treatment were tested with the model. The results
obtained and the advantages and disadvantages of the management scenarios
studied are evaluated and discussed.</p>

<h2> 2. Methodology </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Kranji Reservoir (1°25'N,
103°43'E) is a small and shallow, tropical urban reservoir located in Singapore
(Figure  1A) formed by the impoundment of Kranji River in the 1970s. The
reservoir experiences episodes of eutrophication and recurrent cyanobacteria
blooms. The lake surface area is 3.0<span style='position:relative;top:2.0pt'><img
width=13 height=13 src="010%20-%20IJEPR_files/image001.png"></span>10<sup>6</sup>
m<sup>2</sup> and catchment area is 5.6<span style='position:relative;
top:2.0pt'><img width=13 height=13 src="010%20-%20IJEPR_files/image001.png"></span>10<sup>7</sup>
m<sup>2</sup>. The average depth of Kranji Reservoir is 5 meters while the
depth at the deepest location is about 20 meters. The reservoir receives base
flow and storm runoff from its main tributaries and the direct precipitation on
the reservoir surface.</p>

<br />
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  We apply an integrated
three-dimensional hydrodynamics-ecological model to Kranji Reservoir, the Estuary
Lake and Coastal Ocean Model-Computational Aquatic Ecosystem Dynamics Model
(ELCOM-CAEDYM) developed by the Centre for Water Research, University of
Western Australia [8, 9]. ELCOM-CAEDYM has been applied and evaluated widely in
many different aquatic ecosystems around the world, including lakes,
reservoirs, estuaries and oceans. ELCOM solves the hydrostatic, Boussinesq,
unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and scalar transport equations [8].
CAEDYM provides a dynamic coupling with ELCOM, particularly calculating
ecological processes including oxygen dynamics, nutrient cycling, and phytoplankton
dynamics [9]. For the ELCOM-CAEDYM model of Kranji Reservoir (Kranji model), we
have assumed boundary condition of turbulent benthic boundary layer and used
initial conditions from measured vertical water temperature and water quality
profiles in the reservoir. The discretization of Kranji model consists of
horizontal orthogonal grids with 40<span style='position:relative;top:2.0pt'><img
width=13 height=13 src="010%20-%20IJEPR_files/image003.png"></span>40 m wide cells
as shown in Figure  1B. The grid size of 40 m is chosen taking into account the
bathymetry map resolution and the simulation speed of the model. For the
vertical direction, we have used a total of 21 layers for the maximum depth of
22.5 meters allowing for water level fluctuations. The near surface vertical
resolution is 0.5 meter and decreasing gradually towards the bottom of water
column to improve computational accuracy in the surface layers.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  In this study, we have
run the ELCOM-CAEDYM simulations for 2005 under a total of five management
scenarios, including tests for hydraulic flushing, phosphorus load reduction,
artificial destratification, sediment manipulation and algaecide addition. The
first two belong to watershed management strategies while the others are
in-lake treatment techniques. The details of the settings and results of each
management scenario are presented and evaluated in the next section.</p>

<h2> 3. Results </h2>

<h4> 3.1. ELCOM-CAEDYM Model for Kranji Reservoir </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Calibration of the Kranji
model was carried out by using a combination of biogeochemical parameters
obtained from both literature review of other tropical lakes and field
measurements and laboratory analysis of water and sediment samples collected
from Kranji Reservoir. The model was calibrated by tweaking of important
biogeochemical parameters to fit observed data. The Kranji model was calibrated
and validated against a two-year record (2005 and 2006) of water temperature
and water quality variables [10].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The simulated results
are compared with field measurements for the water surface of Kranji Reservoir
in 2005 (see Figure 2). The calibrated model was found to be capable of
predicting total chlorophyll-a (TCHLA), total phosphorus (TP) concentrations,
total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) concentrations fairly well.
As TCHLA and TP concentrations are the most critical water quality variables
for eutrophic lakes, the model can be used as an effective prediction tool to
evaluate the management scenarios for controlling eutrophication in Kranji
Reservoir. However, due to the scope of this study, the present model has not
quantified the uncertainties from model parameters and input data. We will
investigate the sensitivity of model parameters and the uncertainties of the
model results in further studies.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<h4> 3.2. Water Quality in Kranji Reservoir </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Three water quality
variables measured 1-2 times per month over a 9 month period in 2005 and the
TN:TP ratio computed based on these measurements are plotted in Figure 3. The
TCHLA concentration was found to exceed the eutrophic level of 10 µg/L [11] for
the months considered, with an annual mean concentration of 77 µg/L. Algal
blooms occurred from June to September where the mean TCHLA concentration
reached 116 µg/L during this period. The total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus
(TP) concentrations in the reservoir both increased in late July and gradually
decreased thereafter, indicating increased nutrients input from inflows during
the former period. The TN:TP ratio was found to be higher than the Redfield
Ratio [12] of 7.2 (by weight) for most of the time throughout the year, thus
the phytoplankton in Kranji Reservoir is considered to be phosphorus limiting.
During the algal bloom period from June to September, the TN:TP ratio stays
relatively low, indicating that the relative abundance of phosphorus combining
with warmer weather during Jun to Sep tends to foster the algal blooms. In
contrast, the TN:TP ratio increases significantly to well above 10 from October
to December, coinciding with the notable decrease of TCHLA concentration. It
suggests that the limited phosphorus combining with colder weather during Oct
to Dec tends to suppress the algal blooms.</p>

<h4> 3.3. Management Scenarios Evaluation </h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  To control the
eutrophication in Kranji Reservoir therefore, several management scenarios were
evaluated. Of the watershed management strategies, hydraulic flushing is
believed to be an effective technique in diluting the high-nutrient lake water and
flushing out poorer quality water, thus reducing the phytoplankton population [13].
In the Kranji model, the inflow volumes from the tributaries were doubled. In
reality, doubling of inflows could result from a diversion of inflows from
nearby drainages. The model results show that a doubling of inflows can result
in a reduction of 23.7% in the mean TCHLA concentration for 2005 (see Figure 4A).
Though the reduction is significant, this method is not always feasible due to
the high costs involved and availability of alternate sources of inflows.</p>

<figure>
<img src="010%20-%20IJEPR_files/image006.jpg" class="img"/>

<figcaption>

treatment.</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Reduction or removal
of nutrients loadings from the inflows is one of the most commonly used lake
restoration techniques. It can be achieved by best management practices such as
wetland filtration [14, 15] or direct control and treatment of the point source
discharges [16]. Since it is observed that algae in Kranji Reservoir is
phosphorus-limited, we decreased the phosphorus loadings in inflows by 50%.
Such a reduction can be achieved through engineered systems or legislating
against the use of phosphorus containing detergents. Our model results (Figure
4B) show that a 50% reduction in phosphorus loading can result in a 21.05%
decrease in the annual mean TCHLA concentration. Inflow nutrient reduction is
found to be an effective technique to control eutrophication. However,
integrated water resources management in the watershed is required and
techniques of filtration or treatment of the inflows need to be developed and
implemented.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Aeration systems in
lakes have been widely used to control eutrophication [17, 18]. Artificial
destratification achieved by bubble-plume systems can add oxygen to the water
column and improve mixing. In the Kranji model, simulations without bubblers
and with bubbler operating at a rate of 0.20 m<sup>3</sup>/s were carried out
and compared. Figure 5 shows plots of the simulated vertical profiles of mean
TCHLA concentration at the location of bubbler with and without bubbler operation.
Slight reduction of TCHLA concentration was noticed, affecting only the top 2
meters of water column with no discernible differences in the deeper parts of
the water column. As a whole, bubbler operation resulted in only a 0.01%
decrease in TCHLA concentration. Thus artificial destratification has limited
use in Kranji Reservoir, probably because it is a shallow and polymictic
system. The reservoir undergoes diurnal cycles of stratification and
destratification induced by daytime heating and night-time cooling. And unlike
most temperate deeper lakes, there is no existence of seasonal thermocline in
the reservoir. Thus the effects of the increased destratification contributed
by the aerator on the reservoir water column are limited in comparison to diurnal
destratification due to convective cooling.</p>

</figure>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Sediment manipulation
in lakes is useful when internal nutrients sources from sediments account for a
significant portion of the total nutrients for lake algal growth [19]. Typical
techniques of sediment manipulation include sediment dredging and active
barriers to reduce phosphorus release from lake sediments [20]. In the Kranji
model, the effects of sediment manipulation have been tested by setting the
initial nutrients concentration in the sediments to be zero, simulating the
management scenario after a complete dredging of lake sediments. The results
(Figure 4C) show that despite an extreme reduction in phosphorus release, only
slight improvements in the lake water quality, a mere 2.6% reduction in TCHLA
concentration, was obtained. Sediment manipulation is expensive and cannot
solve the problem of water quality deterioration completely if there exist
continuous excessive nutrients loadings from inflows.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  Chemical treatments
with the addition of algaecides such as copper sulphate, are considered to be
an economical and effective technique to control cyanobacteria blooms [21]. In
the Kranji model, the mortality rate of cyanobacteria was arbitrarily set to
two times the calibrated value to simulate the effects of algaecide addition.
The dosing of algaecide resulted in an average 36.17% decrease of TCHLA
concentration (see Figure 4D). This represents the largest reduction in TCHLA
among all the five management scenarios considered. Although the effect of
controlling phytoplankton population is the most significant, there are
potential drawbacks of this technique. The effects are temporal and the
undesired taste, odour and toxicity associated with the use of algaecides which
may cause adverse changes to other lake processes and ecosystem stability [22]
are main concerns.</p>

<h2> 4. Conclusion </h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">  The effects of the
five management scenarios, in terms of reductions in the TCHLA concentration
and their respective advantages and drawbacks are summarized in Table 1. It was
found that hydraulic flushing, inflow nutrients reduction and algaecide
addition had significant effects on the reduction of TCHLA concentration while
artificial destratification and sediment manipulation had limited effects.
Though algaecide addition is economical and effective, there are serious
concerns in adopting this technique [22]. Compared to the latter three in-lake
treatments, watershed management strategies were found to be the most effective
with fewer drawbacks since inflows from the watershed can exert significant
effects on the water quality of the lake. Of the management scenarios
considered, phosphorus reduction was considered to be the best strategy.
Integrated water resources management on the watershed level is critical
towards preventing eutrophication.</p>
