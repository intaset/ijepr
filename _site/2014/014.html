a major factor in the eutrophication process, modifying water and habitat at
high concentrations. This paper describes the development of a cost-effective,
efficient, and affordable on-site Total Phosphorus (TP) removal technology. By
investigating the chemical adsorption of a clay-zeolite media, the objective
was to demonstrate TP removal capacity with a primary focus on pellet media
design to overall removal efficiency. The investigation included pellet
formation, size, conditioning, furnace exposure temperature and duration, as
well as initial influent concentration (theoretical septic tank effluent range
of 6-20 mg/L), with a response-contact time of 45 minutes. The research
followed various stages of optimization and consisted of a scaled-down testing
unit based on a 1.91 cm pellet diameter construction, for a 45 minute detention
time, and achieved a removal of approximately 45%. </i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A world water crisis is growing as clean
drinking water availability diminishes. Toxic effects on ecosystems from
untreated sewage discharge and land runoff have contributed to another growing
global issue - eutrophication. Eutrophication&nbsp;is how the ecosystem retorts to activities that infect water
bodies with phosphorus and other nutrients; modifying animal
and plan populations, as well as their water and
habitat quality [3].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Sensitive areas prone to phosphorus
contamination from domestic sewage must meet stringent effluent limits,
following surface and subsurface disposal, in order to control the
eutrophication process problem. The Ontario Ministry of Environment standards, outlined
in The Lake Simcoe - Phosphorus Reduction Strategy, must be employed in order
to meet the current baseline compliance limit of 0.30 mgP/L. The current
research focuses on the on-site aerobic treatment of domestic wastewater, and
the analysis of the overall removal efficiency was conducted by employing the
Langmuir and Freundlich Adsorption isotherm models.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">There are various removal technologies,
involving biological, chemical, and physical processes. In order to make an
effective engineering decision, a stringent screening methodology was
considered [1]. The physio-chemical removal process was selected based on its
consistency, and industry acceptability. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The adsorption process
where molecules from a gas or solution phase bind to a condensed layer on a
solid or liquid surface was the basis for experimentation. Adsorption isotherms
are a graphical representation of the quantity adsorbed as a function of
pressure of the gas or solution [5]. The most significant model of mono-layer
adsorption is given by the Langmuir Adsorption Isotherm, whereas the Freundlich
Adsorption Isotherm [9] is a modification of it to involve a multisite analysis
[5]. Ion-exchange is a function of the degree of substitution of aluminium for
silicon in the framework structure [6]. A major attribute of zeolites is their
ability to exchange ions with external media [10]. The process of
adsorption was explored using a clay-zeolite media, which possesses natural
adsorptive and ionic chargeable properties.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A source-specific action was taken by developing
an on-site phosphorus removal unit. The purpose was to obtain a cost-effective,
efficient, and affordable technology, accessible to individual facility owners.
This advancement is unique to the industry, in that it offers a small footprint,
with naturally available raw materials, and a modular design. This development
created a means of reducing the phosphorus of natural water bodies, thereby
overcoming issues associated with eutrophication. </p>



<h2>2. Materials and Methods</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A small testing unit was
constructed in order to assess the performance of the various pellet types. The removal efficiency
relative to initial concentration and contact time was the basis for analysis
and optimization. The testing unit is made of two identical systems of dual
cylindrical compartments, constructed with schedule 40 PVC tubing of 7.62 cm
diameter and 15.24 cm height. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Bentonite clay, kaoline clay, zeolite (sieve
mesh distinctions 8x40 and 14x40) gradations, and deionized distilled water of
various ratios were investigated. A preliminary method involved incorporating
primarily moist clay and zeolite particulates, to form a 1.91 cm diameter
spherical pellet with a melon baller. These pellets were air dried for 24
hours, followed by furnace exposure at 100<sup>o</sup>C and dehydrated for 24 hours,
then gradually increased to 600<sup>o</sup>C, allowing for calcination for 24
hours. Furthermore, another pellet composition was developed from the work of
Jasra et al. [7].
Due to material limitations and porosity objectivity (coarser zeolite), the
amount of clay was modified based on feasibility; overall clay incorporated
into the mix was 80% of zeolite, but still analyzing as described in [7] with a
two clay combination of bentonite and kaoline (hydrous aluminum silicate). A
total of 7 pellet types were formed; six with the bentonite-kaoline blend and
varied zeolite gradations, and one with the moist clay of coarser gradation.</p>

<h2>3.
Experimental Development</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A protocol was developed in order to determine
the optimal pellet type. The optimization testing unit was employed by
analyzing a 1.91 cm pellet diameter.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">According to Song [8], two random packing
factors occur; close (RCP) and loose (RLP). Their respective maximum density,
termed the Atomic Packing Factors (APF), are 64% (RCP) and 55% (RLP),
respectively. The medium of these values was selected at 60%, as stated in Eq.
(1) [2]:</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="014_files/image001.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(01)</div>
<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">With the assumption of a
60% atomic packing factor, the volume of the pellets (V<sub>P</sub>) to occupy
the volume of the testing unit (V<sub>tu</sub>) would be expressed in Eq. (2),
as follows:</p>

<div class="eqn">
<img src="014_files/image002.png" class="img">
</div>
<div class="eqn-number">(02)</div>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In order to determine
the most feasible pellet size, various extraction and pelletizing methods were
explored, including a pelletizing machine, truffle moulds, and measuring
spoons. From the preliminary testing of the consistency of the original
procedure, 6 pellets formed by hand were randomly selected to measure their
diameters, with an average of 1.83 cm.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Various measuring spoons shown in Fig. 1 were
analyzed, converting the volume of half a sphere, and translating it to its
corresponding diameter of a complete sphere; the ½ teaspoon measurement
corresponding to a 1.98 cm diameter. The average pellet and ½ teaspoon
measuring spoon diameters are 1.83 cm and 1.98 cm, respectively. These values
bound a 1.91 cm pellet diameter volume. For repeatability purposes, a
melon-baller of the corresponding diameter-volume was used for pellet
formation. All calculations that followed correspond to a 1.91 cm pellet diameter volume.</p>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To determine the number
of pellets to fill the testing unit, the corrected pellet volume was employed
of a 1.91 cm diameter pellet in Eq. (3) asfollows:</p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This void space
corresponds to the sump volume for experimentation; a 25% safety factor was
applied, such that 0.296 L was carried through testing. In order to account for
time and economic factors to the experiment, specific initial influent concentrations
and contact times (converted to flow rate) were selected. A septic tank's effluent
(apparatus influent) concentration of phosphorus ranges approximately from 6 to
20 mgP/L [4]. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The following
subsections outline the actions taken and the decisions made over the course of
each of the three design stages.</p>

<h4>3.1. Pre-Optimization Stage</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The lower (6 mgP/L), middle (14 mgP/L) and upper
(18 mgP/L) bounds of initial influent concentrations were analyzed from the
various pellet types. Given that only two contact times were explored (15 and
45 minutes) at this stage, the samples were extracted at these times rather
than regenerating the testing unit with influent. The experimental design was
modified due to the constraints of the TP meter (Orbeco MC500 Colorimeter Procedure –
326-Phosphate, Total).
In addition, the pellets were conditioned at maximum solubility with calcium
hydroxide brine to observe the effects on the removal efficiency.</p>

<h4>3.2. Optimization Stage</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Following the discoveries of Pre-Optimization,
the furnace exposure became the major parameter of investigation. In addition,
further exploration of conditioning versus as-received pellet form was
introduced. This stage investigated the effects of conditioning concentration,
as well as furnace exposure (in terms of both temperature and duration) against
the minimum and maximum influent concentrations at two different contact times.
</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Approximately 300
pellets of both Type 6 (clay blend, fine zeolite) and Type 7 (moist clay,
coarse zeolite) were formed; such that 100 non-conditioned, 100 conditioned
with Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>) (C1) and 100 conditioned with
Sodium Chloride (NaCl) (C2). The pellets were exposed to the furnace times of 6
hours at 100<sup>o</sup>C and 600<sup>o</sup>C (Phase I), and 12 hours at 100<sup>o</sup>C
and 600<sup>o</sup>C (Phase II). The pellets conditioned were exposed to a low
(A) and high (B) concentration or maximum solubility of both the Calcium
Hydroxide (Lime) and Sodium Chloride (Salt) brine solutions. The pellets were
submerged in a minimum and maximum influent, 6 mgP/L and 18 mgP/L,
respectively. The effluent was drawn at two different contact times; 15 and 45
minutes.</p>

<h2>4. Results</h2>

<h4>4.1. Pre-Optimization</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The preliminary stage of the experiments began
with testing the Type 7 pellet, at 6, 14, and 18 mgP/L influent concentrations.
These concentrations were analyzed at 7.5 and 15 minute contact times. All
readings indicated over-range for the TP meter; beyond the upper bound of its
0.02-1.1 mgP/L range. Consequently, both the 20 mgP/L stock (based on a 10,000
ppm phosphorus reagent) and 6 mgP/L influents were tested through various 50%
dilutions, all of which were detectable. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This was followed by the analysis of the Type 6
pellet at the minimum influent concentration (6 mgP/L) and maximum contact time
(15 and 30 minutes); once again, with a 90% removal assumed and no dilutions
employed, all readings were undetectable by the TP meter. This was followed by
the analysis of both the influent and effluent of Type 6 and 7 pellets, with
minimum influent concentration (6 mgP/L), and maximum contact time (15
minutes). At this stage, the influent and effluent were exposed to 4- and 3-50%
dilutions as in Table 1 and 2, respectively. Subsequently, these same pellets
were conditioned with calcium hydroxide; there was a successful reading with
dilutions. Table 3 provides a summary of the Pre-Optimization results, which is
based on an influent concentration of 6 mgP/L for a contact time of 15 minutes.</p>

<h4>4.2.
Optimization</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Pre-Optimization confirmed that dilutions were
required to receive TP Meter detection due to the reading restraints of the
narrow range (0.02-1.1 mgP/L). Tables 1 and 2 were employed to the influent and
effluent, respectively, of the optimization stage as well. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"> It is to be noted that when the pellets were
exposed to the influent and minimum conditioning brines (C1A and C2A), a
distinct sizzling sound occurred due to gas formation, and the pellets began to
expand. In particular, when Pellet Type 7 was exposed to Phase I, the pellets
began to 'explode' and fell apart. This is most likely due to the compact,
dense attribute of the pellets. Consequently, Phase I analysis proceeded,
utilizing all pellet fragments in the experiments. The surface area and contact
points were greater, which may have skewed the results in its favour with
greater phosphorus removal. This fragmentation would compromise the pellet
integrity. Consequently, it was decided that Phase II furnace exposure be
observed, thereby ensuring a more stable pellet composition.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Pellet types 6 and 7 were formed, for both Phase
I and II furnace exposures, and carried through for experimentation. The final
pellet type selected was the non-conditioned (NC) Type 7, Phase II (12 hour
furnace exposure). This selection was based on the minor difference in overall
phosphorus removal, taking into account the environmental and economic impacts
of conditioning. This pellet type was recreated and tested once again, and its
results demonstrated consistency; 40% removal was achieved with an 18 mgP/L
influent concentration and 45 minute contact time. </p>



<h2>5. Analysis</h2>

<h4>5.1. Pre-Optimization</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Pellet Types 1 to 4 were not carried through to
the quantitative analysis stage. These pellets were only formed for qualitative
purposes; to observe the workability. Given that Types 1 to 4 were only of one
clay type (Bentonite and Kaoline) rather than a blend (Types 5 and 6), the
overall composition was brittle and consequently not considered ideal for mass
production. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Pellet Types 5 and 6 were very porous compared
to Type 7. Notably, Types 6 and 7 were exposed to more influent cycles than
Type 5, during the preliminary stages of TP Meter detections; in order to
refine the dilution calculations. As observed in Fig. 2, non-conditioned pellet
Type 5 performed similar to that of conditioned pellet Type 7. Based on the
coarser, zeolite gradation used to compose Type 5, the fluid dispersion was
greater, such that the influent was able to traverse more through the material
than the denser pellets Type 6 and 7. However, Type 5 removal was reduced once
conditioned. For comparative purposes, the more compact pellets were carried
further into analysis (Types 6 and 7), concluding that conditioned pellet Type
7 produced the highest removal efficiency from the pre-optimization
perspective.</p>

<h4>5.2. Optimization</h4>

<h4><i>5.2.1.
Contact Time</h4></i>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Fig. 3 indicates that the removal for Pellet
Type 6 is greatest with the Hydrated Lime Brine at maximum concentration (C1B),
whereas Type 7 is more or less consistent whether non-conditioned or exposed to
either conditioning solution at minimum concentration (C1A, C2A). The optimal
removal of both pellet types is close in value.</p>

<br>


<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As shown in Fig. 4,
Pellet Type 6 in phase II is optimal as in phase I; at a maximum Calcium
Hydroxide solution concentration (C1B). For Type 7, the removal is greatest
with once again the Salt Brine at minimum concentration, closely followed by
its maximum concentration. Based on the physio-chemical process of adsorption,
it is important to note that there are various exchangeable cations within the zeolite
structure, including calcium and sodium. By applying the lime and salt conditioning
methods, the goal was to enhance the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of zeolite to
remove the phosphorus anions in solution. Figures 3 and 4 display the CEC performance
of Pellet Type 6, and how this pre-treatment has improved its adsorption performance
to reach that of Pellet Type 7 in its natural state.</p>



<h4><i>5.2.2.
Influent Concentration and Furnace Exposure</h4></i>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Pellet Type 7 overall removal is greatest among
the two, taking into account the various contact times and furnace exposures. A
key observation of the influent concentration results is that the removal was
consistent, given the wide range of 6 to 18 mgP/L. This supports the conclusion
that the septic tank effluent concentrations were addressed most effectively.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The Phase II furnace exposure removal is
slightly greater among the various contact times and influent concentrations.</p>

<h4><i>5.2.3.
Optimization Analysis Summary</h4></i>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This subsection provides an overview of the
major findings from the optimization stage. Table 4 outlines the percent
removal at 45 minutes. For review, NC, C1A, C2A, C1B, and C2B refer to
non-conditioned (as received), minimum (A) Lime (1) and Salt (2) Brines, and
maximum (B) Lime (1) and Salt (2) Brines, respectively. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">With the <i>contact time</i>
parameter analysis at the minimum and maximum influent concentrations and <i>furnace
exposures</i>, it was determined that the performance of the non-conditioned
(NC) or minimum Salt Brined (C2A) pellets were more superior, with  pellet type
7 as optimal; presumably due to greater surface contact and overall ion
exchange. The <i>influent concentration</i> parameter analysis confirmed also
that Pellet Type 7 had a slight advantage in overall removal. The <i>furnace
exposure</i> study revealed that Phase II removal is not only slightly greater,
but also ensures a more stable product. As a result of the analyses, the final
pellet composition was decided as Type 7 NCII taking into account economic and
environmental impacts of conditioning, producing an optimization removal of 45%
at the 45 minute contact time.</p>


<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The overall objective of this research was to
further the development of a cost-effective, efficient, and affordable on-site
Total Phosphorus (TP) removal unit. Employing chemical adsorption technology,
the clay-zeolite media was analyzed for a pilot unit to demonstrate the TP
removal capacity from an artificial influent, simulating domestic wastewater
effluent concentrations. The analysis to overall removal efficiency was based
on media composition and formation, conditioning, influent concentration, and
contact time exposure.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The analyses determined that Pellet Type 7 with
Salt Brine conditioning solution at minimum concentration (C2A) and Phase II
(12 hour furnace exposure) provided the greatest removal efficiency of 70%.
However, the 25% removal efficiency difference among the non-conditioned and
conditioned results was not substantial to account for the significant future
impacts. As a result, from an economic and environmental perspective, the
as-received (non-conditioned) Pellet Type 7 was deemed optimal for final mass
fabrication.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">There were key observations made during
optimization. With regards to the influent concentration analysis, the septic
tank effluent concentration range was applied to the pellets with a minimum and
maximum concentration of 6 and 18 mgP/L, respectively. The investigation
demonstrated that the extreme influent bounds provided similar removals;
indicating an effective system. </p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">There are various recommendations that can be
drawn from this research. It should be noted that all pellets were
analysed based on a single-feed, influent to pellet exposure. Further
observations into multi-feed systems and how this would impact the pellets' performance
would be useful for future investigations. Environmental conditions such as moisture and
humidity, and freeze-thaw cycles should be investigated, which would better
represent the field conditions. The field testing should also look into the
life-cycle analysis of an apparatus, and to determine at what point would the
media need to be either regenerated or replaced. With regards to regeneration,
the conditioning brine disposal must be taken into consideration to prevent any
adverse effects on the environment. In terms of replacement, the spent pellet
material must be studied with the possibility for further use, such as fertilizer
and its effects on the environment (i.e. leaching into the soil, and
subsequently into the waterways). The research work presented an
environmentally sustainable solution, and contributes to the development of a
total phosphorus reduction strategy to restore, improve and protect our
environment.</p>
