Time and cost often compete in guiding engineers during the design phase of remediation plans.  While time and cost are primary focuses for most private industry clients, regulators, and citizens; choosing the correct technology to address the fate and transport of contaminants does not necessarily align to time and cost allotments.  To ensure the success of a remediation plan in addressing the removal of contaminants, it is important to focus on the incentives behind the remediation effort.  This review provides a comparative analysis of the three drivers of remediation: Risk, Regulation, and Real Estate.  Based on the driving R, the selected remediation engineering technology can be more appropriate in serving the ecosystem needs and sociopolitical implications. While time and cost will remain major drivers, this comparative study demonstrates that the success of contaminant removal is equally dependent on the tools and technologies applied to the geospatial and geopolitical environment.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In 2004, the United
States Environmental Protection Agency estimated that for the years 2004-2033 there
will be approximately 294,000 hazardous waste sites to remediate and the
cleanup costs will amount to nearly $209 Billion United States Dollars [1]. In response to this market
trend, federal, state, and local government and private industry will tackle
the anticipated demand by seeking 1) technologies, 2) skilled professionals,
and 3) smarter and more cost/time effective solutions to existing and up and
coming complex environmental pollution [1]. Investors on the other hand, will pursue innovative
technologies and promising real estate that has a potential for a lucrative
technical and financial future. In alignment with market needs, universities continue
to adjust their curricula in environmental science and engineering to prepare future
professionals for this complex challenge where no two remediation sites are
alike.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As electronic
applications dominate our daily lives, the field of remediation engineering
remains dependent on geomechanical design processes set in design blueprints
and spreadsheets. The complexity of this field from assessing the
classification of contaminants, to determining the parameters for lab testing,
to investigating soil types and elevations, and calculating water flow and pump
curves, necessitates introducing easy to use matrixes for sound and quick decision-making.
</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As electronic
algorithms become more functional through the smart application of data
utilization and automated technologies, the matrix environmental professionals
utilize to design remediation plans is outdated in comparison. Even though a
smart app that resolves remediation strategies may be futuristic, the objective
of this paper is to delineate the 3Rs that drive remediation projects. Based
on the driving R: Risk, Regulation or Real Estate - the selected remediation
engineering technology can be more appropriate in serving the ecosystem needs
and sociopolitical implications. While time and cost will remain major
drivers, this comparative study demonstrates that the success of contaminant
removal is equally dependent on the tools and technologies applied to the
geospatial and geopolitical environment. Using a matrix, that acknowledges which
specific technologies will better perform based on the driving R, will
facilitate the design of remediation plans and assure the proper management of
the contaminant resulting in the long-term reduction of health costs, ecosystem
impacts, and federal funds.</span></p>

<h2>2. Background</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In describing
the complexity of the environmental field of remediation, Suthan S. Suthersan
said it best: </span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>"Scientists and engineers
practicing remediation engineering have to learn the nuances of investigative
techniques, data collection, and treatment technologies. This education
includes a new understanding of the physical and chemical behavior of the
contaminant, the geologic and hydrogeologic impacts on the fate and transport
of these contaminants, the human and environmental risks associated with
contaminations, and the selection of appropriate technologies to provide
maximum mass transfer and destruction of the contaminants" [2].</i></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In determining
the protocol for this study it became apparent that one of the main objectives
is to produce a graphical, easy to use, algorithm to guide decision makers and
engineers in quickly selecting some of the available technologies based on the
driving factor for the project in question. In the same way electronic
algorithms learn and adapt to the consumer choices and behaviors, an
engineering algorithm can provide the field with a tool that can be applied to
the various project needs and parameters of interest. The key is to simplify
the study tool to provide a first step approach to the plethora of available
tools and matrixes in remediation technologies. The tool provides a unique
approach by focusing on one of the 3Rs as a project driver: Risk, Remediation,
or Real Estate versus time and cost.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Before creating the
graphical algorithm to serve as a quick and easy reference and in order to
comparatively cross-examine technologies to project drivers, the following two
targets will be addressed:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; First: Define and select remediation technologies that are appropriate for various scenarios and are well established in the field. This will be conducted by investigating the literature and industry experts to produce a list of ten proven and commonly utilized technologies.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Second: Provide a comparative analysis of the 3R drivers as they relate to priorities and success factors.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Study Targets: Remediation Techniques and Comparative
Analysis of 3Rs</h2>

<h4>3. 1. Remediation Techniques</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The Federal
Remediation Technologies Roundtable (FRTR) produced a remediation reference
guide in a cooperative effort by various federal agencies to include the United
States (U.S.) Department of Defense, the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of
Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
and more. The reference guide also included a Treatment Technologies Screening
Matrix [3]. The matrix is composed of approximately 60 treatment
technologies grouped into water versus soil clean up applications. The matrix
also provides a cost and time performance measure. To date, the FRTR matrix
and reference guide remain as one of the most comprehensive and easily
accessible guides to environmental engineers working in the remediation
industry.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This study will
utilize technologies that are aligned with the FRTR database. To better focus
this paper, the ten technologies selected for this study are dominated by in
situ treatment options with the exception of "Pump &amp; Treat" and "Dig &amp;
Haul" options. In situ remediation uses on site methods to treat the
contaminant on location in efforts to save money, time, transportation cost, liability,
and disposal fees [4]. Moreover, the ten selected remediation
technologies are well established and referenced in textbooks used to educate
future engineers such as CRC Press's textbook titled Remediation Engineering Design
Concepts [2]. The ten selected technologies are listed and
described as follows:</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 1. Pump &amp; Treat</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Used primarily for
groundwater decontamination applications. Contaminated groundwater is pumped
to the surface. The contaminant is then removed from the groundwater by
aboveground treatment methods, such as filtration, and the clean water is
re-injected or released to either the sewer or a surface water body. Another
option after pumping the contaminated water is to dispose the contaminated
water as a stored hazardous substance. Pump and Treat is common in treating
dissolved chemicals in water. In addition, the pumping process contains the
contaminant plume and prevents it from migrating to other water resources to
include drinking water wells and wetlands [2], [5].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 2. Dig &amp; Haul</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Dig and haul is
an ex situ approach to soil remediation techniques that utilizes construction
equipment and heavy machinery. Dig and haul focuses on excavating contaminated
soils and disposing of them as hazardous material waste in appropriate
landfills. Timely excavation of the contaminated soils can play a significant role
in preventing the spread of the contaminant through the water table and wind
dispersion [5].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 3. Air Sparging</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Used separately
or integrated in conjunction with other techniques, air sparging is the pumping
of air to volatize volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and semivolatile organic
compounds sorbed to soil and in the groundwater. The addition of air
specifically beneath the water table expedites the movement of volatiles
through the path of least resistance towards the surface. Air compressors are
usually utilized through injection wells to produce sufficient air pressure to
mobilize contaminants [3], [5]. The addition of oxygen for air sparging has the
added benefit of creating an aerobic environment that could assist with
biodegradation levels.</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 4. Vacuum Enhanced Recovery</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Also known as
dual phase extraction, Vacuum Enhanced Recovery removes through negative
pressure (high vacuum system) both dissolved and free phase non-aqueous phase
liquid (NAPL) contamination, and vapors in groundwater and the vadose zone. While energy intensive, this remediation technique is effective and unique for extracting
both liquid and vapors at the same time. Vacuum Enhanced Recovery is also
referred to in the literature as vacuum enhanced extraction, and bioslurping
[2], [3].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 5. Reactive Walls/Zones</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">An in situ
approach to mass removal and treatment of contaminants in large areas where
other mechanical technologies may be cost prohibitive and troublesome due to
generating hazardous waste for disposal. The approach of reactive walls/zones
also known as "permeable reactive barriers" [5] is to utilize impermeable and permeable barriers and
gates downgradient of the contaminant plume or a series of injection wells
acting as a curtain to immobilize and/or transform the contaminant to
non-harmful byproducts. This technique is also referred to in the literature
as "funnel and gate systems" or "treatment walls" [2]. 
Decontamination usually occurs through chemical reagents addition, oxygen
infusion, and/or filtration of the substance underground following a set
hydraulic pattern.</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 6. Stabilization &amp; Solidification</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Stabilization
and Solidification processes can range in implementation depending on whether the
contaminant is encapsulated or bound onto a solid to prevent the contaminant
migration and facilitate the excavation of the waste product [5]. The primary benefit of this technology
is that solidification prevents contaminant leaching from surfaces and soils
into the groundwater, surface water bodies, and stormwater runoff and drains. Specifically,
the solidification process binds contaminants with reagents changing their
physical properties -especially hardness, while stabilization refers to a
chemical reaction that reduces waste leachability [6].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 7. Soil Vapor Extraction</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Soil Vapor
Extraction is used to remediate soils from volatile and semi volatile organic
compounds. Also known as soil venting and vacuum extraction, Soil Vapor
Extraction utilizes in situ technologies to remove contaminant vapors through
extraction wells with the use of blowers or vacuum pumps. The extracted vapors
or "off-gasses" are then treated onsite with various above ground treatment
methods such as thermal or catalytic oxidation or condensation. The Soil Vapor
Extraction method is applicable to the vadose zone since extracting water will
damage the system and will require the Vacuum Enhanced Recovery method
instead. The mechanical set up of Soil Vapor Extraction is easily integrated
to other remediation technologies such as Air Sparging [2], [5].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 8. Bioventing</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Bioventing
refers to the use of low airflow to stimulate aerobic biodegradation of
contaminants and mobilization of volatile compounds through the soil. This
technique is also compared to soil venting in the literature [3]. Bioventing not only reduces vapor treatment costs, but also can
consequently remediate semi volatile organic compounds that are not directly
volatized [2].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 9. Bioremediation</h4

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Under both
aerobic and anaerobic conditions, bioremediation is the degradation of organic
contaminants in soil and water through microbial metabolism. Bioremediation
can be enhanced through the addition of oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, nitrate, and
nutrients. When acceleration of the naturally occurring biodegradation process
is limited, bioaugmentation is utilized by adding exogenous microorganisms on site. The microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, metabolize contaminated compounds to innocuous mineral products [2], [3].</span></p>

<h4>3. 1. 10. Phytoremediation</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Phytoremediation
is the use of photosynthetic plants to uptake contaminants in the soil or
water. Phytoremediation is especially effective for removing inorganic
compounds, metals, pesticides, and explosives when the contaminant is at low
levels tolerable by the plants. Phytoremediation provides the added benefit of
soil stabilization -known as phytostabilization- by preventing wind and water
runoff and dispersion of contaminants [5]. Phytoextraction is the process in which the plant extracts
the contaminants above the soil surface into the plant shoot and leaves while
contaminant degradation in the rhizosphere can also occur in the root zone of
the plants with the symbiotic relationship augmenting the process by
"incorporating bacterial, fungal, insect, and even mammalian genes into the
plant genome" [2] to provide an opportunity for biodegradation
at the root system.</span></p>

<h4>3. 2. Comparative Analysis of the 3 R Drivers</h4>

<h4>3. 2. 1. Risk Drivers</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">When it comes
to risk drivers, many stakeholders are involved in scrutinizing the remediation
process of a contaminated site. These stakeholder entities range from state
and federal agencies, environmental consulting engineers, to local citizen
action and advocacy groups [7]. Yet, public pressure remains one
of the strongest components in how risk is perceived and how regulatory
standards react. Preferably, clients and companies will avoid environmental
risk by taking risk precautions [8]. Unfortunately that
is not always feasible based on cost and liability limitations. For example, depending
on cost, a company might not be willing to invest large sums of money to avoid
negligible risks perceived by the public. Contrarily, the public, investors,
or companies may refuse to invest any money to reduce actual demonstrated risk due
to associated costs or inconvenience [9]. This example is
best demonstrated by the use of cell phones while driving in absence of local
laws. Another validation are the survey results indicating that in the absence
of state laws requiring passenger restraints/seat belts, only 15% of American
drivers routinely use them [9].</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As public
perception is critical in the success of risk driven remediation projects, it
is important to assess risk not only from a regulatory standpoint but also at a
societal level. Society at large influences not only the level of perceived
risk to human health but also the risk to ecosystem impacts, and the risk of
mobilization, biomagnification, cross-contamination and chemical persistence. 
Meanwhile, regulatory drivers depend on established exposure limits by federal,
state and local agencies and entities such as the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration. In determining the regulatory exposure limits many risk
assessment standards are considered for determining dosages. One value that is
frequently used is "the No Observable (Adverse) Effect Level (NOEL). The NOEL
includes effects, such as minor weight loss, that are not considered to be
adverse. These values are applicable only to that species in which the test
was conducted. Extrapolation to other species will require dosage adjustment"
[9]. Regulatory standards are generally designed to stay
within thresholds in which no adverse effect will occur. Especially when it
comes to predicting cancer risk, many guidelines offer a NOEL of a 1/1,000,000
risk level as an acceptable risk [9]. Risk management thus,
depends on evaluating various response alternatives, both regulatory and non
regulatory [8].</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Since risk assessment
supports setting regulatory thresholds, and risk assessments are based on non-adverse
and acceptable levels of risk as more stringent thresholds are cost
prohibitive, it is important to then prioritize risk drivers as follows:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Ability
to "stop the bleeding": the technology that most rapidly immobilizes the
contaminant to prevent migration and cross-contamination to include reducing
short-term and long-term exposure limits through ingestion, inhalation and
dermal absorptions.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Cost-effectiveness:
high energy intensive and mechanically dependent applications can be cost
prohibitive as many of these facilities become a federal liability in the
absence of private investors or responsible corporations.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Public
Acceptance of technology: it is important that the technologies utilized onsite
or offsite not be intimidating to the public or ecosystem considering noise
levels, byproducts and off gases (smell), risk of explosion, and accidents
during operation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. 2. 2. Regulatory Drivers</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In determining
remediation mitigation plans, "both industry and government have their
respective roles to play. Ever-increasing parts of that role, and the keys to success, are sound cost control practices and techniques" [7]. Due to the complex nature of these remediation plans, many of the
regulation drivers place emphasis on schedule compliance rather than cost. There
is a lack of guidance with regards to cost estimating (e.g., standardized cost
databases and cost guides) to aid regulators in the process of identifying
cost-effective and sound technology decisions and approaches. Nevertheless,
corporations are becoming more aware that their environmental image and
footprint is directly affecting their bottom line. The public attention on
environmental impacts is significant and will continue to surge with increasing
levels of public awareness [8]. Environmental
compliance costs cannot only consider violation fees. There are costs related
to complying with federal, state, and local requirements to include permitting
costs, technology modification costs, changing source materials, environmental
auditing, and creating and maintaining an environmental management system
[8].</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Therefore when
prioritizing regulatory drivers, the following factors remain important in
order of criticality, from most to less, as follows:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Compliance
of technique: prioritizing environmentally friendly low-impact and low-byproduct
methods of decontamination, especially those of high public acceptance.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Initial
time to set up and implement cleanup technology: to achieve lower risk of
mobilization of contaminant and halt the noncompliance regulatory fees.</li>
	<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Cost-effectiveness: since as indicated by Richard A. Selg (1993), cost control practices are a key area for project success.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. 2. 3. Real Estate Drivers</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Real Estate
drivers are compelled by a distinctive set of values that are primarily focused
on profit, time and cost efficiencies, land value, property potential, and
historical and social significance of the real estate. Private investors and
land developers usually control the ownership of Real Estate driven remediation
projects. Even though the developers will comply with regulatory requirements,
the priorities rest in the efficiency of the cleanup versus the techniques
utilized. Nevertheless, investors are now more aware of environmental
concerns. This awareness is driven by the company's earnings, net worth, cash
flow, acquisition potential, divestiture, and financing strategies that are
impacted by environmental obligations and liabilities [8].</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Remediation
projects in the real estate industry are featured by specific characteristics. 
The language utilized to enhance and encourage property advancement in the
future includes words such as "adaptive reuse" and "reconstruction" versus
remediation. These words are selected carefully to entice and incentivize the
future customer. Future customers include shoppers and recreational users that
will invest in purchasing services and property in the residential, commercial,
or retail real estate sectors. Examples of real estate developments on
remediated sites include golf courses, commercial office space buildings,
shopping centers, historical landmarks and more.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Richard Selg
indicates that the "most common approach to eradicating cost growth is to
revisit the basis of the estimate and to ensure that the current estimate
accounts adequately for known scope as well as uncertainties surrounding the
accomplishment of the current scope of work" [7]. In real
estate driven remediation projects time is money setting the priorities as
follows:</span></p>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Time
Effectiveness: Efficiency of remediation plan to include quick set up and
mobilization, fast contaminant removal, and utilization of existing on site
construction material and equipment.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Liability:
The effectiveness of the remediation technology to comply with regulations and
ability to transfer liability to other entities (for example landfills).</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Complexity:
Less complex systems are attractive to real estate investors since they reduce
the dependency on technology modifications, intellectual property, and the
engagement with field specific contractors that take up time and cost to set up
and mobilize.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Results and Algorithms</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Real Estate driven
environmental remediation projects are usually motivated by high cost, high
energy, high mechanical expenditures, and fast treatment technologies that
mimic construction sites. In contrast, Regulation drivers are lower cost, more
environmentally friendly, and less mechanically intensive applications. Risk drivers
are more socially acceptable technologies that prioritize halting the
contaminant migration and providing further damage protection.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Figure 1 displays the
compiled results of this study in a graphical algorithm that serves as a quick and easy reference guide of comparatively cross-examined technologies and
project drivers.</span></p>

<h4>4. 1. Influence of Risk Drivers on Remediation Technology Applications</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The influence
of risk drivers on remediation technology applications are determined from most
applicable to minimally applicable, as follows:</span></p>

<i>Highly Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Reactive
Walls/Zones:</u> Useful in containing hard to treat underground and groundwater plumes from migrating and posing risks to various other systems. Can be less energy intensive and less costly than pump and treat operations.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Stabilization &amp;
Solidification:</u> Attractive due to fast response stabilization and immobilization of contaminants especially in emergency response situations.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Soil Vapor
Extraction:</u> More attractive than Vacuum Enhanced Recovery for removing VOCs and semi VOCs from a risk perspective since Soil Vapor Extraction is less mechanically intensive, easier to control off gases, and quick onsite set up and mobilization.</li>
</ul>

<i>Moderately Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Pump &amp; Treat:</u> Even though cost prohibitive and energy
intensive, Pump and Treat can be one of the very few methods that allow for
hydraulic manipulation to control groundwater plume migration.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Dig &amp; Haul:</u> Cost prohibitive in many instances;
however, timely excavation of contaminated soils provides reassurance that air dispersion and water contamination will be prevented.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Vacuum Enhanced Recovery:</u> Even though applicable, the highly mechanical set up poses risks of off gas explosions and other mechanical failures reducing attractiveness especially from public perspective.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Bioventing:</u> Bioventing relieves the concerns originating from high pressure air sparging. For long-term interventions, utilizing oxygen
as a treatment method is publically acceptable.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Bioremediation:</u> Both regulators and the public embrace
this method that was initially based on natural attenuation principles. Minimal risk can be incurred if bioaugmentation is introduced.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Phytoremediation:</u> As in bioremediation, this natural method
of contaminant uptake is highly favorable. Risk concerns emerge due to
contaminated plants (stalks and leafs) consumed by animals/birds and may
require proper disposal offsite.</li>
</ul>

<i>Minimally Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Air Sparging:</u> Potential to jeopardize foundations nearby,
migration of plume due to air pressure, and potential to increase off gases in underground structures, conduits, and basements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. 2. Influence of Regulation Drivers on Remediation Technology Applications</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The influence
of regulation drivers on remediation technology applications are determined from
most applicable to minimally applicable, as follows:</span></p>

<i>Highly Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Vacuum Enhanced Recovery:</u> The dual phase extraction capability of this technique reassures regulators that both vapor and dissolved contaminants are addressed and provides a faster way for the
client to reach compliance.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Reactive
Walls/Zones:</u> An innovative technique that provides an in situ alternative for pump and treat and reduces hazardous disposal offsite. Can integrate many remediation media to address organic, inorganic, and elemental contaminants.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Stabilization &amp; Solidification:</u> A time efficient technique that allows for emergency response. In addition, it prevents future contamination and reduces violations costs.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Soil Vapor
Extraction:</u> A time proven method that allows for quick set up and mobilization when treating VOCs and semi VOCs.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Bioventing:</u> Regulators favor techniques that allow for low-risk natural methods such as bioventing, also known as soil venting.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Bioremediation:</u> A trendy method that allows for land and
resource preservation using the basis of natural attenuation. Also, this
technology provides clients/violators with mitigation negotiating
possibilities.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Phytoremediation:</u> Added benefits of land stabilization,
hydraulic cycle support and soil enrichment highlights this method of
remediation.</li>
</ul>

<i>Moderately Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Pump &amp; Treat:</u> A high energy and high cost old school method has left regulators more impressed by reactive zone on site innovative
methods especially when pumped water is disposed of as hazardous waste offsite or overwhelming local sewer plants (which require coordination with local authorities).</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Dig &amp; Haul:</u> Considered an effective yet old school method of remediation, regulators like to see technology innovation that reduces
offsite hazardous waste transfer.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Air Sparging:</u> Some concerns emerge if foundations or basement/underground structures are nearby.</li>
</ul>

<i>Minimally Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; Not applicable since all identified
technologies in this study are accepted by regulatory agencies.</li>
</ul>


<h4>4. 3. Influence of Real Estate Drivers on Remediation Technology Applications</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The influence
of real estate drivers on remediation technology applications are determined from
most applicable to minimally applicable, as follows:</span></p>

<i>Highly Applicable:</i>

<ul>
	<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Pump &amp; Treat:</u> Even though costly, real estate investors are happy to save time due to large coverage area and the option to store and dispose contaminated water offsite.</li>
	<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Dig &amp; Haul:</u> Another costly technique, this method is highly applicable to contaminated soils allowing investors to use the same construction set-up and excavator machinery to remove contaminated soils and dispose of them in a timely manner in approved landfills.</li>
	<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Air Sparging:</u> The high pressure air sparging to stimulate biodegradation and assist the contaminants in volatizing is an attractive technique in larger project sites where there is no fear of jeopardizing residential basement structures/infiltration and the mobilization of plume to neighboring land.</li>
	<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Vacuum Enhanced Recovery:</u> Intensive mechanical and energy set up, yet dual phase extraction of both liquid and gas contaminants simultaneously covering large sites makes this attractive when cost is not an issue compared to time.</li>
</ul>

<i>Moderately Applicable:</i>

<ul>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Reactive
Walls/Zones:</u> Cost and time of trenching before utilizing trenches for treatment is not as attractive to real estate developers.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Stabilization &amp; Solidification:</u> Solidification is more attractive in this driver if the material could be solidified and kept
onsite without generating any risks.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Soil Vapor
Extraction:</u> Vacuum Enhanced Recovery is usually preferred since it is a dual phase extraction process applicable to larger areas saving time.</li>
  <li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Bioventing:</u> More applicable to low concentration of contaminants that are less volatile. Added advantage of biodegradation is not realized due to time requirements of biostimulation lag period.</li>
</ul>

<i>Minimally Applicable:</i>

<ul>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Bioremediation:</u> Long period of acclimatization and contaminant degradation. In addition cannot be implemented on land to be redeveloped and constructed.</li>
<li align="justify" style="padding-left:19.85pt">&#8226; <u>Phytoremediation:</u> Long period of plant growth and contamination uptake. In addition cannot be implemented on land to be redeveloped and constructed.</li>
</ul>


<h4>4. 4. Sample Case Studies</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">When
approaching a newly discovered contaminated area or spill, professionals can be
overwhelmed with the number of technologies and techniques available to
remediate any given site. After all, the FRTR matrix provides approximately 60
treatment technologies. The objective of the 3Rs approach presented in this
paper is to facilitate a broader method to initial selection of remediation
techniques - independent of the nature of the contaminant or the environment affected. 
Figure 2 provides a questionnaire based decision matrix for guidance and to
further demonstrate the application of each driver on choice of technology, Table
1 provides a list of case studies categorized by driver and technology listed
by reference and location. Four case studies, included in Table 1, are further
evaluated as follows:</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>Case Study 1: Risk</i></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Removed in 2004
from the National Priority List of superfund sites, the South 8<sup>th</sup>
Street Landfill in West Memphis, Arkansas [10] is a great example of a
"Risk" driven remediation approach. The South 8<sup>th</sup> Street Landfill
has completed the third five-year review with a determination that the site
remains protective of human health and the environment and that the site
controls prohibiting excavation and drilling within the specific landfill areas
will prevent future exposure pathways. The 16-acre landfill site and two and a
half acre oily sludge pit was a "Risk" driven project since the site is
adjacent to the Mississippi River and is on the two-year flood plain. The
groundwater table within the alluvial aquifer beneath the site sits just a few
feet to 20 feet below the ground surface. It was important to protect the
Wilcox aquifer that provides drinking water supply to the City of West Memphis
approximately two to four miles from the site. The contaminants of concern
included the oily sludge hydrocarbons, municipal and industrial waste, lead,
and carcinogenic poly aromatic hydrocarbons to name a few. The site is treated
with stabilization and solidification, which as shown in Figure 1 is a highly
applicable method for risk driven projects due to the rapid "ability to stop
the bleeding," lower cost in preventing contaminant migration, and public
acceptance.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>Case Study 2: Real Estate</i></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The Vertac
Superfund Site in Jacksonville, Arkansas in EPA Region 6 [11] is a great
example of a "Real Estate" driven remediation plan. The site used since 1948
and purchased by Vertac Chemical Corporation in 1978 is now remediated with the
third five-year review concluding that the site remains protective of human
health and the environment as published on May 13, 2014. The 193 acres site
was contaminated with chlorinated hydrocarbons with dioxin contamination found
in both the soil and drummed waste. The site is not a direct threat to the
public, and the underlying aquifer is not used for public water supply or
domestic use. Approximately 1,000 residents live within one mile of the site. 
The site is also adjacent to industry and an air force base. Per Figure 1, the
3R driver focuses on "Real Estate" highly applicable technologies to include
both "Dig &amp; Haul" and "Pump &amp; Treat". Excavation of contaminated soil
was completed in the late 90s and groundwater extraction wells were installed
to eliminate to retract the contaminant plume from the ground water. Other
techniques were also used such as demolition of buildings, off-site
incineration and decontamination, that align with the more expensive "Real
Estate" priority of time effectiveness, compliance with regulation, and less
complex systems to enhance repurposing efficiency. The industrial/commercially-zoned
site is now repurposed to include the city's recycling center, and police and
fire department training facilities.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>Case Study 3: Regulation</i></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Since all the
techniques presented in this study are acceptable by regulatory agencies, perhaps
some of the best case study demonstrating regulatory and penalty driven
remediation projects, are dry cleaning establishments. For larger
establishments, due to the associated cost and liability of remediation, many
of these establishments after bankruptcy or abandoning the site become
superfund sites and get placed on the national priority list depending on their
risk to human health and the environment. However, this is not the case for
many smaller businesses such as dry cleaners. A notable press release by the
EPA in 2002 demonstrated the importance of penalties when it comes to
compliance [12]. The EPA cited 11 dry cleaners in New Jersey proposing
a total of $37,850 in fines. A total of 114 dry cleaners were also cited in
New York and New Jersey combined [12]. The EPA has created many mechanisms
to better educate and cooperate with dry cleaning establishments to reach
compliance. One of the main objectives is to protect public health and the
environment from percholoroethylene (a suspected carcinogen and irritant), and
other toxic air pollutants. As a result many dry cleaners are now encouraged
to use more environmentally friendly products to meet compliance and protect
the workers and the public.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;"><i>Case Study 4: Multiple Approaches and Multiple Drivers</span></i></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">In many cases,
a cookie cutter approach to site management is not possible since many drivers
compete for priorities in addition to the always-critical cost and time components. 
In such scenarios multiple technologies may be applicable. From Table 1,
multiple case studies demonstrate a combination of regulatory and risk drivers. 
Similarly, a number of case studies include a combination of technologies such
as "Soil Vapor Extraction" as well as "Air Sparging" which go hand in hand in
removing VOCs. It is important to note that multiple approaches can be
applicable and many decisions can fall back on the experience of the
remediation engineer, contractors, and what they are more familiar in
practicing. The proposed 3Rs approach is intended to serve as a reference that
better organizes the technologies and options and provides guidance to
engineers for determining a priority driver outside the given cost and time
factors that are present in most projects.</span></p>

<h2>5. Conclusions</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The field of
remediation engineering is highly complex and multidisciplinary. From
assessing the classification of contaminants, to determining the parameters for
lab testing, to investigating soil types and elevations, and calculating water
flow and pump curves. This complexity necessitates the introduction of easy to
use reference matrixes for sound and expedited decision-making. There is no
cookie-cutter approach in remediation engineering; no two projects are alike. This
study introduces a matrix that guides engineers to acknowledge specific drivers
and technologies that better perform independent of the nature of the
contaminant and the environment affected. In an effort to facilitate the
initial set of decisions required to select adequate remediation technologies,
this paper presents an approach that focuses on three prevalent drivers, the
3Rs: Risk, Regulation, and Real Estate.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Selecting the
correct technology to address the fate and transport of contaminants does not only
align with time and cost allotments. While time and cost will remain major
drivers, the success of contaminant removal is equally dependent on the tools
and technologies applied to the geospatial and geopolitical environment. There
are multiple treatment technologies and hundreds of treatment technology
combinations of which at least 60 are organized and referenced in the FRTR. To
better focus the paper, ten remediation technologies that are well established
in the field are identified, defined, and used for illustration purposes. 
Further research can extend the 3Rs method to include other remediation
technologies in addition to the coupling of technologies and drivers through
the proposed 3Rs approach. A remediation engineer can better navigate
available and valuable information when better guided by a broadly applicable
approach that defines the priorities for a successful outcome.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Secondary to
cost implications, the case studies demonstrate that the underlying objective
for a successful implementation plan can be attributed to either protecting
public health, complying with regulations, profiting from potential real estate
value, or a combination of the above. The comparative analysis concludes that "Real
Estate" environmental remediation projects are usually driven by high cost,
high energy, high mechanical expenditures, and fast acting treatment
technologies that mimic construction sites. "Regulation" drivers are lower
cost, more environmentally friendly, and less mechanically intensive.  "Risk"
drivers are more socially acceptable technologies that prioritize halting the
contaminant migration and ensuring protection from further harm.</span></p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">By addressing
the Risk, Real Estate, and Regulation impacts of the project, the design
process can more efficiently address the fate and transport of contaminants and
associated hazards. Understanding the R driver of the remediation project -by
focusing on Risk, Regulation, or Real Estate project incentives- will help engineers
formulate a more systemic approach resulting in a more socioecologically
friendly and publicly acceptable contaminant removal outcome.</span></p>
