<p align="justify"><i><strong>Abstract- </strong>
Liquid fuel
derived from renewable resources is one of the technologies under development
as part of "biorefining" platforms. Fisher-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is a
commercial technology producing alternative fuels from coal (CTL-
Coal-To-Liquid) and natural gas (GTL; Gas-To-Liquid). FTS Biomass-To-Liquid
(BTL), although not yet at the market level, is a continuously-growing field,
and its successful commercialization depends on improving techno-economic
sustainability.</i></p>

<p align="justify"><i>In a previous study by the
authors' research team, a plasma-synthesized nano-iron carbide catalyst
(PS-Nano-FeC) demonstrated direct relationship to the presence of iron carbide
high-FTS and water-gas-shift (WGS) activity, with high-catalyst stability and
regenerability in a 3-phase slurry, continuously-stirred tank reactor (S-CSTR).
Although these results, along with a recently-published phenomenological model,
are indicators of the industrial potential of this catalyst, transport
phenomena, chemical mechanisms and their intrinsic kinetics are needed as
reactor scale-up tools.</i></p>

<p align="justify"><i>In the work reported here,
the PS-Nano-FeC catalyst was tested in a S-CSTR with hexadecane as liquid
carrier. We evaluated the optimal operating conditions for a surface-reaction,
kinetics-controlled regime.</i></p>

<p align="justify"><i>The results include: (1)
Reactant conversion and product yields; (2) Fresh and used catalyst instrumental
analyses; (3) A model considering all transfer and surface kinetics,
accompanied by proof of the rate-controlling step.</i></p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2> 
<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Escalating crude oil
prices and environmental considerations are motivating great interest in
shifting from fossil to biomass and waste resources as feedstock of
transportation fuels. Biomass and waste gasification involves a combination of
partial oxidation and steam reforming, leading to synthesis gas production with
controlled hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>)/carbon monoxide (CO) ratio. The latter is
defined by the needs of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis BTL processes. FTS reactions
are commonly simplified as a combination of Fischer-Tropsch FT (Eq. 1) and
water-gas-shift (WGS) reactions (Eq. 2)</p>

<div class="eqn">

<div class="eqn-number">(2)</div>
<br><br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">where n is the average
number of carbon atoms and m is the average number of hydrogen atoms of
hydrocarbon (HC) products. Water is a primary product of FTS reactions, and CO<sub>2</sub>
is mainly produced by WGS reaction. Iron-based catalysts have high WGS rates [1].
Although WGS is not a desired reaction, its extent may be exploited to adjust
poor H<sub>2</sub>/CO reactant mixtures. Ruthenium and cobalt-based catalysts
have negligible WGS activity, but the low cost and high stability of iron
catalysts, especially when they are alkali-promoted, make the latter more
attractive FTS catalysts. Most of these iron catalysts, used for many years
industrially [2, 3], are prepared by precipitation techniques [4, 5, 6]. In a
previous paper, Blanchard et al. [7] presented a novel catalyst preparation
method employing a plasma-spray technique for the production of a
nano-iron-carbide catalyst. This preparation method allows large batch
production amounts and gives spherical core-shell iron carbide-graphitic carbon
nanoparticles. The graphitic shell provides easy handling of the catalyst in
ambient conditions without significant oxidation extent. The carbon-based shell
needs preliminary <i>in situ</i> H<sub>2</sub> reduction to activate the
catalyst prior to FTS.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">A major aspect in the
development of commercial FTS is the choice of reactor type [8]. The 2 most
favourite systems for FTS are the multi-tubular trickle bed reactor and the
slurry bubble column reactor. Their advantages and disadvantages have already
been published [9]. The slurry reactor has the following main advantages over
its competitors: 4 times lower differential pressure over the reactor; lower
catalyst loading; excellent heat transfer characteristics resulting in stable
and homogeneous reactor temperature; introduction of fresh catalyst is possible
during runs; and lower investment capital. To scale-up such a FTS reactor,
kinetics studies are necessary to identify the rate-controlling steps and range
of operating conditions, allowing for surface-reaction kinetics control of the
phenomenon. In the present work, the reactor tested was a 3-phase slurry,
continuously-stirred tank reactor (S-CSTR) that is considered be an ideal, fully-mixed
reactor, meaning that the following attributes/hypotheses were considered:
perfect mixing (gradientless reactor, i.e., global uniformity of concentration
and temperature throughout reactor volume). Conditions under which
surface-reaction kinetics are the rate-limiting step were determined, and a
50-h FTS experiment was run under optimum conditions to examine catalyst
stability over time-on-stream.</p>

<h2>2. Materials and Experimental Methodology</h2>
<h4>2.1. Catalyst Preparation</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Iron carbide nanoparticles were prepared according
to a previously-reported plasma spray technique [7].</p>

<h4>2.2. Catalyst Characterization</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The catalyst produced by
plasma was characterized prior to its reduction by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). XRD analyses disclosed the presence of 2
iron carbide phases (Fe<sub>5</sub>C<sub>2</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>C) in a
graphitic carbon matrix; some unconverted metallic iron was also identified
(Figure 1). SEM analyses (Figure 2a) revealed unconverted iron spheres and 20-
to 100-nm dispersed nanoparticles (Figure 2b).</p>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The particle size
distribution of plasma synthesis powder was assessed by laser diffraction with
a Hydro 2000S Malvern Mastersizer Instrument. Measurement was undertaken with
the nanopowder dispersed in dry ethanol. Number particle size distribution
(Figure 3) confirmed that particle diameter was below 100 nm. The specific
surface area of the catalyst was 67 m<sup>2</sup>/g and was measured by N<sub>2
</sub>physisorption after overnight degassing at 200°C, according to the
Brunauer-Emmett-Teller method in a Micromeritics ASAP2020 apparatus.
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) by a TA Instruments apparatus, coupled with a
mass spectrometer to follow the CO<sub>2</sub> produced, was performed for
elementary analysis of the synthesis catalyst. A 10°C/min heating rate was
imposed between ambient temperature and 1,000°C under 50-ml/min airflow. Air
oxidation of carbides, amorphous and graphitic carbons led to iron III oxide,
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>, as the only solid end-product. 34% iron weight
composition was ascertained in the plasma synthesis catalyst. For FTS reaction,
gas space velocity was based on elemental iron mass calculations.</p>

<h2>3. FTS Reaction</h2>
<h4>3.1. Experimental Set-Up</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">The reaction apparatus is
depicted in Figure 4. It includes an Engineer’s Autoclave set-up designed for
high pressure and temperature reactions. The reactor is of 600-ml capacity and
is equipped with a magnetic stirrer engaging a turbine impeller in liquid phase
operating up to 3,000 rpm. Inlet reactant gas mixture composition is controlled
by a Brooks mass flow meter connected to a premixed gas tank whose composition
is representative of reformed biosyngas derived from thermal gasification with
pure oxygen (11% CO<sub>2</sub>, 33% CO and 56% H<sub>2</sub>), a pure hydrogen
gas tank to adjust H<sub>2</sub>/CO ratio and perform catalyst reduction
pre-treatment, as well as an argon (Ar) gas tank to purge the system during
stop and carrier liquid (hexadecane) feed. Inlet gas is fed into the reactor by
a perforated, annealed pipe as sparger/diffuser at the reactor bottom. Outlet
flow is heat-traced at 150°C to a high-pressure trap maintained at ambient
temperature. Pressure is regulated by a micrometric needle valve. Expanded gas
enters a 0°C trap and goes through a micrometric filter before exit gas flow monitoring
by a BIOS Definer dry volumeter. Gas composition is analyzed continuously with
a Varian micro-GC CP-4900 equipped with 2 columns, CP-Sil and CP-COX, coupled
with a thermal conductivity detector. Periodic off-line gas analysis was
performed by a Varian GC CP-3800 equipped with successive columns (Haysep T and
Hayesep Q) coupled with a flame ionization detector (FID) to quantify C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4
</sub>and<sub> </sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> concentrations. Off-line
analysis of the liquid product collected in the high-pressure trap was
conducted with a Varian GC CP-3800 equipped with a capillary 0.25 mm x 0.5 &#956;m x 100 m (CP7530) column coupled with a FID
detector.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Prior to testing, the FTS
nano-iron-carbide catalyst was activated <i>in situ</i> at 400°C for 6 h under
a pure H<sub>2</sub> flow rate of 6.7 ml/g<sub>cat</sub>/min and 500 rpm
stirring. Hexadecane served as inert liquid carrier after saturation with Ar to
avoid oxygen feed. 200 ml was fed into the reactor by means of an
Ar-pressurized tank.</p>

<h4>3.2. Mass Balance Calculations</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">As
Blanchard et al. (2010) described previously, this set-up does not allow direct
full mass balance. However, conversion of the reactants can be calculated
appropriately considering their absolute amount in the inlet and outlet
streams, including gas hold-ups in the reactor and high-pressure condenser.
With this protocol, CO and H<sub>2</sub> conversions were calculated, as was CO<sub>2</sub>
production. To consolidate mass balance and access to carbon molar selectivity
values, the following hypotheses were made: (a) the formation of oxygenated HC
products was assumed to be negligible, and (b) all liquid HC products were
considered to have an average atomic H/C ratio=2.2.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">
	CO consumption kinetics to HC was expected to
follow Eq. 3.</p>

<h4>3.3. Kinetics Study</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Prior to analyzing the
influence of operating conditions on reactant conversions and selectivity, it
is always necessary to check for mass and heat transfer limitations. Eq. 5
expresses the reaction rate as a function of all resistances in a 3-phase
slurry reactor [10].</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">where C<sub>i  </sub>represents
the concentration of i species in liquid phase (mol/m<sup>3</sup> solution), R<sub>A</sub>
is the apparent reaction rate (mol/m<sup>3 </sup>solution.s), k<sub>b</sub> is
the mass-transfer coefficient for gas absorption (m/s), a<sub>b </sub>is<sub> </sub>the
bubble surface area (m<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>3</sup> solution), m is mass
concentration of the catalyst (g<sub>catalyst</sub>/m<sup>3</sup> solution), k<sub>c</sub>
is the mass transfer coefficient to the catalyst (m/s), a<sub>c</sub> is the
external surface area of particles (m<sup>2</sup>/g), &#951; is the catalyst
effectiveness factor, and k (m<sup>3</sup>/g<sub>cat</sub>.s) is the specific
reaction rate. Different resistances were extracted to determine the limiting
step: r<sub>b</sub>(s) expresses gas absorption resistance, and r<sub>cr</sub>(s),&nbsp;diffusional
resistance to (external mass transfer) and in (internal mass transfer) the
catalyst. Considering the nanometric size of the catalyst particles, the
effectiveness factor was close to 1, and internal mass-transfer resistance
could be neglected. It was experimentally demonstrated [11] that intra-particle
diffusion limitation was significant in case of FTS for particle diameters
above 1 mm; below 63 &#956;m, no intra-particle diffusion limitation was
apparent and fully intrinsic kinetics were observed [12]. r<sub>cr</sub>
expression can be so reduced to Eq. 6.</p>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Stirring rate was the
first parameter studied. Efficient stirring maintains homogeneous catalyst
suspension and bulk liquid concentration and minimizes gas bubble size. Thus
the resistances attributed to gas-liquid absorption and to diffusion between
bulk liquid and external surface of the catalyst particles respectively are minimized.
The conversion of gas reactants was monitored under conditions unfavourable to
gas absorption (relatively low pressure and high temperature, e.g., 10 bars and
275&deg;C, respectively) and relatively large catalyst load (16.5 g) requiring high
stirring rates to reach homogeneous suspension and fast reaction kinetics. The
stirring rate was varied between 250 and 2,500. Corresponding results are
presented in Figure 5. Above 2,000 rpm, CO conversion reaches a plateau,
indicating that higher stirring rates do not improve the reaction rate. The
results reported in Figure 5 led us to choose the safe value of 2,500 rpm in
subsequent runs aimed at minimizing gas absorption resistance.</p>

<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">To ensure a
surface-reaction-kinetics-limited regime, catalyst loading was varied to
estimate gas absorption limitation. Three catalytic tests were undertaken with
4.5, 2.25 and 1.125 g catalyst loading in 200 ml hexadecane. CO conversion was
monitored, and a C<sub>CO</sub>/&nbsp;(-R<sub>CO</sub>)=f(1/m) chart was built.
CO concentration in hexadecane was estimated (13), and R<sub>CO</sub> was the
apparent CO consumption rate. Figure 6 shows that surface reaction kinetics +
liquid-solid diffusion resistances were together overwhelmingly higher than gas
absorption resistances. However, since the experiment was performed at 2,500
rpm, liquid-solid diffusion resistance was not limiting, as see in Figure 5.
Consequently, surface-reaction-kinetics resistance was definitely the
rate-limiting step, and this procedure allowed the phenomenological evaluation
of such resistance.</p>

<h4>3.4. Sources of
Experimental Errors and Preliminary Statistical Analysis</h4>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Reactor inlet flow is
controlled with a mass flow meter. The measured precision is +/-3%. The BIOS
Definer dry volumeter used to measure the exit gas flow has a theoretical
measurement error of the order of 0.1% but a real precision of 1% has been
considered. GC analysis precision depends upon the products; except propane,
exhibiting a fairly high error of 15%, all other gases measured have errors in
the range of 1-2.5%. The reproducibility tests have shown a maximum error of 3%
on reactants conversion as well as WGS and FTS selectivity calculations.
Regarding the liquid FTS products, the errors related to each particular
molecular weight component is a function of the latter. The basic hypothesis
used is that all peaks have the same conversion factor. More details can be
found in Abatzoglou et al. [14] and Blanchard [15].</p>

<h2>4. Catalyst Efficiency and Stability</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Proof of catalyst efficiency and stability over
time-on-stream was the last contribution of our paper. Figure 7 reports the
results obtained under conditions described in the legend.</p>

</figure>
<br>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">This experiment took place in the set-up depicted
in Figure 4. The term semi-continuous is used because a part of the product,
the heavier components, accumulates in the reactor during the 50h duration run.
Although the catalyst evolves towards more oxidized forms, as shown in previous
publication of our group (16), this experiment shows a remarkable stability in
terms of reactants (CO) conversion and FTS selectivity.</p>

<h2>5. Conclusion</h2>

<p align="justify" style="text-indent:19.85pt;">Our work has produced new data on a novel
plasma-produced FTS nano-iron carbide catalyst. This new knowledge is critical
for eventual scale-up of the technology.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal; text-align:justify;">
	<li style="margin-left: 90px;">Although,
slurry-phase reactors are characterized by the advantage of higher heat
transfer rates, thus rendering this process control easier and more efficient,
mass transfer phenomena are complex and their control is rather difficult. In
the case of the nanocatalysts used in this work, gaseous reactants are
transferred (solubilized) in the liquid carrier+products phase (G-L transport),
then diffuse at the surface of the catalysts (L-S transport) and are adsorbed
by its active sites. Since these nanocatalysts have no internal porosity other
than that of the surrounding carbon matrix, internal mass transfer, which is
usually the slowest mass diffusion step, is not an issue. This work has
determined stirring conditions, which ensure optimal G-L mass transfer rates in
the S-CSTR used. These optimal conditions mean that the overall phenomena are
not mass-diffusion controlled.</li>

<li style="margin-left: 90px;">As
a consequence of the above, under rather unfavourable mass transfer conditions,
the results clearly show that the nanometric characteristics of this catalyst
allow surface-reaction-kinetics to be the rate-controlling phenomenon of FTS
reactions.</li>

<li style="margin-left: 90px;">The catalyst
has demonstrated excellent efficiency (more than 90% CO conversion) and
stability in a 50-h run under optimal CO conversion conditions. Moreover, FTS
and WGS selectivity, defined and measured in (14, 15), have been equal stable
over time-on-steam for this 50h run.</li>

<li style="margin-left: 90px;">A parametric analysis,
using this catalyst as well other Fe and Co-based plasma-derived formulations
is the next step of the running work.</li>
