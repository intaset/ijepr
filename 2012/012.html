<p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>The occurrence of numerous emerging
contaminants such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the
environment have</span> been reported since they became a &quot;hot topic&quot;
in the late 1990's. The detection of these substances in environmental waters
is challenging because they are found at very low concentrations and are also
structurally heterogeneous. Current analytical techniques used to detect these
substances are generally designed to target only a fraction of these compounds
and have not yet been adapted to the detection and the identification of unknown
substances. It is however crucial to study the presence of transformation
products of emerging contaminants that can be potentially found in the
environment after biological or chemical degradation. New analytical techniques
are thus necessary to screen for the presence of large numbers of suspect
emerging contaminants and their degradation products in environmental samples.
High resolution-mass spectrometry (HRMS) is a promising technique that has the
potential to address the shortcomings of present analytical techniques. Past
work with HRMS applied to environmental analysis showed its potential to: i) screen suspect organic contaminants in surface and
drinking waters collected in several locations across Canada, ii) screen and
confirm the presence of cyanotoxins in algae samples
from the Saint-Lawrence River, and iii) elucidate the probable structure of ozonation transformation products of emerging contaminants
such as 17&#945;-ethinylestradiol. The advantages and
disadvantages of HRMS are discussed here along with strategies proposed in
order to further improve its performance.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4> 

<p class="body">The presence of contaminants of
emerging interest, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products in
environmental waters have been frequently reported in the scientific literature
in the last 15 years (Monteiro and Boxall 2010). Our capacity to detect
ultra-trace amounts (&lt; 100 ppb) of these substances has been due in part to
improvements in analytical instrumentation. For example, in the case of liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) the limits of detection have been lowered
by a factor of 10<sup>4</sup> in the last 20 years (Barceló and Petrovi&#263; 2007). However, technology development
is not the sole factor. Analytical methodology has also played a major role. In
the preface of <i>Advances in the
Identification and Analysis of Organic Pollutants in Water</i> (Keith 1981), Lawrence H. Keith wrote a few
lines that could be considered nowadays almost prophetic: </p>

<p class="body"><i>"There still remains much to be learned about
the kinds of pollutants in water and the chemistry involved. Until we have the
correct methodology for analyzing organic compounds, we will continue to miss
some even though they maybe literally right under our noses."</i></p>

<p class="body">One can say
that emerging contaminants such as pharmaceuticals have been present in the
environment since they were commercially available. In the
case of some substances such as ibuprofen, introduced in 1969 (Rainsford et al. 1997), for more than 40
years. However, just as Keith foretold it, the occurrence of ibuprofen
in the environment was not reported until 1998 (Ternes
1998) and in Canada until 2003 (Metcalfe
et al. 2003). So even today, in spite the powerful analytical
instruments available to scientists many more organic contaminants may still go
undetected. Why? Because the large majority of analytical methods of detection
of these substances are target methods, i.e. they only detect what they are
designed to look for. Ultra-trace target methods, based in low-resolution mass
spectrometry (LRMS), are designed to preserve only a small amount of
information about the composition of the sample; the rest of this analytical
information being lost. </p>

<p class="body">Another
limitation of the conventional methods of analysis based on LC-MS, is that contrary to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
(GC-MS), databases for the identification of small molecules are still in
development. Presently GC-MS libraries allow the identification of more than
212 000 different compounds (National Institute
of Standards and Technology 2011), however similar searchable databases
for LC-MS contain far fewer entries (&lt;65 000 in MetLin
and &lt;15 000 in MassBank as of December 2012). One
of the main reasons for the late development of such LC-MS databases is the
lack of reproducibility of collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra which
is sensitive to instrument design and operation parameters such as mobile phase
composition, flow rate, organic modifiers, etc. (Hough
et al. 2000; Josephs and Sanders 2004).</p>

<p class="body">For this
reason, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is a promising technique that
has the capacity to fill the gaps of present ultra-trace target methods based
on LRMS. In HRMS, ions are measured at a high resolving power i.e., ions with
slightly different <i>m/z</i> ratios can be
distinguished from one another (Price 1991; Watson
and Sparkman 2007). While there is no precise value of the resolving
power necessary to consider a mass measurement as &quot;high resolution&quot;,
it is generally accepted that acquisition of mass spectra with a resolving
power measured at full with half-maximum (R<sub>FWHM</sub>) &gt; 5 000 should
be considered as HRMS (Gross 2004). Mass
spectrometers such as the time-of-flight (TOF), the Fourier transform-ion
cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) and the Orbitrap are
HRMS instruments since they are capable of reaching R<sub>FWHM</sub> &gt; 20
000 in the range of <i>m/z</i>300-400  (Krauss et al.
2010). The most important feature of HRMS is the capacity to determine
molecular formulas from accurate mass measurements in complexes matrices. HRMS
is not absolutely necessary to perform such measurements (Bristow 2005),
however this technique becomes highly advantageous when working with complex
matrices which may contain many isobaric interferences (same nominal mass but
different exact mass) as it is the case in environmental analysis. </p>

<p class="body">Other
authors have discussed the trends and emerging application of HRMS to the
analysis of micropollutants (Hogenboom et al. 2009; Krauss et al. 2010; Petrovi&#263; et al. 2010).
There are examples in literature of the application of this technique to the
field of environmental analysis such as screening (Nurmi et al. 2012) or determination (Farré et al. 2008) of emerging contaminants in wastewaters or
surface waters and detection and identification of transformation products (Vanderford et al. 2008). The objective of this
manuscript is to clearly demonstrate the potential of HRMS for environmental
analysis using several examples of application of the authors' research.
Advantages and disadvantages of this technique are also examined and approaches
and strategies are proposed in order to improve current analytical performance
and streamline data analysis.</p>

<h4>2. Methods</h4>
<p class="subhead">2.1 Sample Preparation</p>

<p class="body">Sample
preparation is described elsewhere (Lajeunesse
et al. 2012; Larcher et al. 2012; Segura et al. 2011). Briefly for the
rapid screening of suspect organic contaminants, drinking and surface waters
samples were collected from rural and urban locations across Canada distant
from point sources of contamination such as wastewater treatment plants.
Samples (500 mL) were extracted in triplicate with Oasis HLB solid-phase
extraction cartridges (500 mg), evaporated to near dryness and reconstituted to
500 µL (Segura et al. 2011). For the
screening and confirmation of cyanotoxins,
freeze-dried samples of the alga <i>Lyngbya</i><i> wollei</i> (20-50 mg, dry mass) were ground and extracted
by ultrasonication with 1 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid in
50% methanol-50% water. Extracted samples were then evaporated to dryness and
reconstituted to 500 µL (Lajeunesse et al. 2012).
Samples used for the structural elucidation of ozonation
transformation products were prepared by adding 500 µg L<sup>-1</sup> of O<sub>3(</sub><sub>aq</sub><sub>)</sub>
to a solution containing 250 µg L<sup>-1 </sup>of 17&#945;-ethinylestradiol
and 250 µg L<sup>-1 </sup>of 17&#945;-ethinylestradiol,
2, 4, 16, 16-d<sub>4</sub>. Samples were then preconcentrated
200 times by solid-phase extraction prior to analysis (Larcher et al. 2012).</p>

<p class="subhead">2.2. Sample Analysis</p>

<p class="body">All experiments were carried out using liquid
chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry performed with an Agilent 6530
Accurate-Mass QTOF mass spectrometer coupled to a 1200 series LC system of the
same manufacturer. For the screening of suspect organic contaminants and the
analysis of cyanotoxins, electrospray ionization
(ESI) in the positive mode was used. For the structural elucidation of ozonation transformation products, atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization (APCI) in the negative mode was employed. Details about the
specific parameters of each application are found elsewhere (Lajeunesse et al. 2012; Larcher et al. 2012; Segura
et al. 2011). The &quot;Find by Molecular Feature&quot; function of the MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software was used to
perform data processing. This function uses an algorithm based on
chromatography parameters (relative height, retention time) as well as on mass
spectrometry parameters (exact mass, isotopic abundance and isotope peak
spacing) to assign a score (probability match) to the unknown compounds
studied. Validation experiments (Segura et al.
2011) showed that a score &#8805; 80 was the minimum threshold to avoid false
negatives while limiting the number of false positives. Once the signal is
identified, the presence of the compound was confirmed by MS/MS experiments or
by comparison with the retention time of a standard.</p>

<h4>3. Results</h4>

<p class="subhead">3.1 Rapid
 Screening of Suspect Organic Contaminants</p>

<p class="body">HRMS was applied to screen the presence of
organic contaminants that could be potentially found in drinking and surface
waters. In this type of non-target method, the mass spectrometer is set to
acquire high-resolution mass spectra (resolving power  &gt; 10 000) in a large mass range
(e.g.<i>m/z</i> 100-1500 ) that results in a
multitude of signals being recorded in the acquisition files simultaneously.
Not all the signals recorded in these files are relevant, as it is the case of
background signals or of contaminants due to sample manipulation. Therefore in
order to perform a suspect screening (also called post-target screening), a
database of compounds is used to perform a search in the acquisition files
according to predefined parameters such as mass accuracy, isotopic pattern,
signal intensity, etc. (Segura et al. 2011).
This approach is much less work-intensive.</p>

Fragement ion of desethylatrazine generated by MS/MS. This ion corresponds to a known product ion of desethylatrazine, which confirms its presence in the sample. C. Comparison with a pure standard spiked in a non-contaminated water sample, shows the same retention time as in A, which further validates the result obtained.</figcaption>
</figure>



<p class="body"> and more effective than examining the
most intense signals in an attempt to identify unknowns since many compounds
may share the same molecular formula but have different molecular structures,
i.e. they are structural isomers (Segura et al.
2011). In addition, not all the substances found in the samples might be
environmentally relevant. Therefore, while this approach still targets specific
compounds, it relies on a database which includes contaminants of interest
selected for their known or suspected toxicity or their potential to be present
in the environment at high concentration, e.g. high production volume
chemicals. Also, one of the many advantages of suspect screening methods is
that the suspect database can be updated and data reprocessed in the future
when the awareness of a novel contaminant becomes &quot;emergent&quot;.
Application of a suspect screening method to drinking and surface water samples
collected in urban and rural settings across Canada, revealed that from the 246
common water organic contaminants present in the database (containing
pesticides, pharmaceuticals and personal care products among others) at least
one organic contaminant was found in 5 out of 11 drinking water samples and in
3 out of 5 surface water samples. The drinking water sample with the highest
number of matches (five compounds) was the Montreal tap water (Figure 1).
Suspect contaminants found in this sample with a high score (&#8805; 80) were: desethylatrazine
(a degradation product of simazine and atrazine), simazine (herbicide), atrazine (herbicide),
2-aminobenzimidazole (fungicide)</p>

The product ion of <i>Lyngbya wollei</i> toxin-1 was observed while performing MS/MS experiments on a pure standard and the product ion of <i> Lyngbya wollei</i> toxin-6 is theoretically possible according to the fragmentation mechanism of an analogue (Sleno et al. 2004).</figcaption>

<p class="body"> and trenbolone
(steroid). Of the surface water samples analyzed, the one collected from the
Saint-Lawrence River had the highest number of matches with a score &#8805; 80: 2-aminobenzimidazole
(fungicide), desethylatrazine, simazine,
atrazine and butyl benzyl phtalate (plasticizer).
However, only the presence of desethylatrazine, simazine and atrazine could be confirmed in these samples
by comparison to standards. These three compounds have been previously
quantified in surface and drinking waters by target methods in the region of
Montreal (Garcia-Ac et al. 2009).</p>

<p class="subhead">3.2 Screening and Confirmations of Cyanotoxins</p>

<p class="body">A similar
approach was also applied to the confirmation and screening of cyanotoxins produced by the filamentous benthic
cyanobacteria <i>Lyngbya</i><i> wollei</i> (Lajeunesse et al. 2012). In order to screen
the presence of cyanotoxins in the samples an
in-house database containing 46 hepatotoxins and
neurotoxins was used with the MassHunter Qualitative
Analysis software. Results showed that the samples did not contain any microcystins or cylindrospermopsins
and only 5 cyanotoxins had a high score (&gt; 80): dihydroanatoxin-a, hydroxyhomoanatoxin-a(S/R),
<i>L. wollei</i>
toxin-1, <i>L. wollei</i>
toxin-5 and <i>L. wollei</i>
toxin-6. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments confirmed the presence <i>L. wollei</i>
toxin- 1 and <i>L. wollei</i>
toxin-6 in the algae extracts. </p>

<p class="body">In the
experiments performed by Lajeunesse et al. (2012), a
target method had already quantified <i>L. wollei</i> toxin-1 in algae samples, however using the
accurate mass measurements obtained by HRMS, the presence of this cyanotoxin was confirmed with a higher degree of certainty.
The detection of <i>L. wollei</i>
toxin-6 is also a very good example of the potential of HRMS in environmental
analysis. Since no analytical standard is available for this cyanotoxin, no target method based on conventional
approaches could be developed to detect it. However, using a non-target
approach this saxitoxin analogue (<i>L. wollei</i>
toxin-6) was found and confirmed with a high degree of confidence (Figure 2).</p>

<p class="subhead">3.3 Structural Elucidation of Ozonation Transformation Products</p>

<p class="body">HRMS was
also applied to elucidate the structure of ozonation
transformation products of the synthetic estrogen, 17&#945;-ethinylestradiol.
Contrary to biological modifications such as glucoronidation
and methylation that can be easily monitored by mass spectrometry, reaction
products of ozone with an organic molecule cannot be easily predicted since it
involves complex reaction pathways (Ikehata et
al. 2006; Masten and Davies 1994) resulting in many cases in the
formation of new functional groups such as carboxylic acid, ketone and alhehyde after the cleavage of double bonds or aromatic
rings. Experiments showed that after ozonation</p>

Structures were assigned according to the structures reported by Vieira et al. (2010).

</figure>



 <p class="body"> of a pure standard a
complex mixture of transformation products was generated. Two ozonation transformation products could be identified with
excellent mass accuracy (&lt; 2.03 ppm): one with a mass of 302.1517 u and the
other having a higher mass of 344.1628 u (Figure 3A). The corresponding
molecular structures were assigned according to structures proposed in previous
studies (Vieira et al. 2010). These
structures were further confirmed using deuterated
standards (Figure 3B), which suggested that the assigned molecular structures
were most likely correct.</p>

<h4>4. Discussion</h4>

<p class="body">The results described
previously demonstrate that suspect screening methods using HRMS are a
promising tool in the field of environmental science. Coupled with sample
enrichment techniques such as solid-phase extraction, they are sensitive enough
to detect organic contaminants at the parts-per-trillion level and are not
limited by availability of standards or to a few numbers of analytes.
By using larger databases, thousands of compounds can be searched in the
acquisition files at once, with minimal operator input. However, these methods
are still in their infancy and much analytical development is still necessary
in order to benefit from the full potential of HRMS. The sample preparation is
a key aspect that needs to be improved, since only extracted compounds can be analysed.
Therefore solid-phase extraction methods capable of extracting a broader number
of substances with high recovery (&gt; 80%) are desirable. The use of other
ionization sources such as atmospheric pressure chemical ionization or
atmospheric pressure photoionisation might also be
necessary since it is unrealistic to expect that all organic contaminants
present in a given sample will ionize with the same efficiency under
electrospray ionization. </p>

<p class="body">Another key aspect of screening methods that
must be improved is the confirmation of potential matches. Since these methods
have the potential to identify thousands of compounds in a given sample, it is
not practical to confirm them all using pure standards. Also, as it is the case
for the cyanotoxins, some analytical standards might
not be available. Since MS/MS libraries, which would help identifying compounds
using their fragmentation products, are still in development, an interesting
avenue is the use of software capable of predicting fragmentation mechanisms. Such
software is already available (e.g. HighChem's Mass
Frontier and ACD/Labs' ACD/MS Fragmenter) and will
certainly emerge as a tool to help better understand the HRMS fragmentation
spectra of potential matches, thus reducing the number of false positives.</p>

<p class="body">Concerning the structural elucidation of new
contaminants, the advantage of using HRMS for such experiments is that high
mass accuracy (&lt; 5 ppm) can be attainable in complex matrices, which has the
advantage of reducing the number of possible molecular formulas for a given <i>m/z</i> ratio,</p>

<p class="body">One of the
difficulties currently found while attempting the structural elucidation of
transformation products is the large number of compounds generated by the
various transformation processes (ozonation,
photolysis, bacterial metabolism, etc.). Structural elucidation by HRMS could
be improved by the integration of ultra-performance liquid chromatography in
the method, providing better chromatographic resolution. Better separation
could help to reduce spectral interferences and simplify the elucidation
process. Also the use of multiple stage mass spectrometry experiments allowing
successive MS/MS experiments in specific ions is desirable considering that
this approach would further simplify data interpretation. However, in some
cases a complete structural elucidation based solely in HRMS is not yet
possible with the current technology. The correct spatial distribution of atoms
in the molecule requires other powerful techniques such as nuclear magnetic
resonance.</p>

<h4>5. Perspectives</h4>

<p class="body">HRMS instruments do not yet have the
sensitivity or dynamic range offered LRMS systems such as the triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (QqQMS)
and required for ultra-trace analysis. For these reasons, the QqQMS is presently the best choice for quantification,
especially at ultra-trace levels. However, the many advantages of HRMS over
LRMS techniques for qualitative analysis suggests that hybrid instruments
capable of acquiring spectra at high resolving power such as the quadrupole-TOF spectrometer or the linear ion trap-Orbitrap will be more frequently used in the field of
environmental analysis in the near future. </p>

<p class="body">The capacity to perform identification of
unknowns based on accurate mass measurements is one of the most powerful
applications of this technique, since as mentioned earlier, large searchable
LC-MS databases for small molecules are still in development. Unknown
identification is further enhanced with MS/MS or multi-stage tandem mass
spectrometry (MS<sup>n</sup>) since fragmentation of
precursor ions reveals additional structural information that helps eliminate
potential matches.  Another of the key
applications of HRMS is its capacity to preserve a higher amount of information
from the samples than LRMS instruments. In HRMS methods, the detection is performed
over a wide <i>m/z</i> range (e.g. 50-1000 <i>m/z</i>) and not at pre-defined <i>m/z</i> values as in LRMS methods.
Therefore, the possibility to re-analyse acquisition files to screen for the
presence of &quot;new&quot; emerging contaminants is an attractive feature that
is not possible when performing target analysis in LRMS instruments. </p>

<p class="body">It is important to stress that now that
technological advance has put in the hands of scientists such powerful
instruments, emphasis should be given to the correct methodology. Key steps
before HRMS analysis such as sample preconcentration
and purification, ionization and separation are thus essential to this
technique. Sample preconcentration can be improved by
using SPE phases of different chemistries such as reversed-phase and ion
exchangers in order to maximize analyte retention.
Regarding ion formation, other atmospheric pressure ionization techniques
should be tested besides ESI such as APCI and atmopsheric
pressure photoionization (APPI). The use of multiple ion sources in positive
and negative polarity ensures that a larger amount of compounds is being
detected. This aspect is particularly important when studying transformation
products since the parent compound can ionize very well with one ion source in
a given polarity but its transformation products could not. Finally, liquid
chromatography remains one of the most important aspects of method development
since proper separation facilitates identification and can reduce matrix
interferences. Recent techniques such as hydrophilic interaction chromatography
(HILIC) offer an interesting alternative over established techniques such as
reversed phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) for the separation of polar
compounds.</p>

<p class="body">Just as Lawrence Keith said it more than 30
years ago, the presence of new pollutants will be still missed if the methods
used are not appropriate, even with the most advanced analytical instruments.
The same applies to the success of HRMS in the field of environmental analysis.</p>


<h4>6. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">The examples given in this manuscript on the
application of HRMS to environmental analysis show the potential of this
technique to help solve some of the problems faced by many scientists in the
field due to the complexity of environmental samples. They showed that HRMS,
coupled to proper sample preparation techniques, databases and data processing
algorithms, could potentially allow the screening of thousands of compounds
simultaneously in a given sample. Also new substances generated during
wastewater treatments or in the environment could be identified and this, with
a high degree of confidence. While HRMS methods are still in development and
instrumentation is still out of reach for most environmental science
laboratories, without any doubt HRMS has the potential to become one of the most
important analytical techniques in this field of research.</p>
