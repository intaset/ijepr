    <p class="body"><b>Abstract</b> - <i>As part of a comprehensive study on the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature focusing on woodland, we evaluated the role of the Ryukoku forest in air purification. The Ryukoku forest, located at Seta Hill in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, is composed of a mixture of conifer and deciduous trees. There are two mechanisms by which forest air is purified: the deposition of air pollutants onto leaf surfaces and the effect of a tree wind break (air pollutant break). We measured vertical distributions of the nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>) concentration inside and outside the Ryukoku forest using passive samplers attached to a 25-m-tall observation tower and to neighbouring university campus buildings, respectively. Wind tunnel experiments that treat atmospheric dispersion among model trees and cannot consider the effect of deposition were conducted to evaluate the effect of a tree wind break. The observed NO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the forest floor showed a 30 percent decrease compared with that above the canopy top. The results of the wind tunnel experiment for four parallel rows of model trees showed a decrease in the concentration of air pollutants inside the forest comparable to the observation in the Ryukoku forest. However, the decrease in the concentration of air pollutants from the top of the canopy to the forest floor was not observed in the wind tunnel experiment. It is deduced that the low NO<sub>2</sub> concentration inside the forest compared with that outside the forest is mainly due to the tree wind break effect and that the variation in the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration with the height from the canopy top is mainly due to the deposition of air pollutants onto leaf surfaces.</i></p>

<h4>1. Introduction</h4>

<p class="body"> It is well known that forests
contribute to improving the atmospheric environment because they play a crucial
role in air purification by the uptake and deposition of air pollutants. Nowak
et al. [1] revealed that trees and forests remove substantial amounts of
pollution and can produce substantial health benefits, particularly within
urban areas. Field observation studies of
forest air pollutants can be found in the literature. For example, Fontan et
al. [2] measured vertical profiles of the ozone concentration in a pine forest
in the Landes region of southwest France. A positive gradient of the ozone
concentration at the vegetation level and at the ground level was observed in
relation to a temperature inversion. Lamaud et al. [3] measured ozone fluxes at
the same site as Fontan et al. and found that the ozone uptake by the
understorey of short vegetation accounts for a significant portion of ozone
deposition. Cox et al. [4] measured vertical ozone profiles in a 15.7-m-high
forest canopy at the University of New Brunswick woodlot in Fredericton,
Canada, and found a 50 percent reduction in the ozone concentration from the
canopy top to the breast height. Krzyzanowski [5] conducted a similar
observation in a 13-m-high forest canopy in the Lower Fraser Valley, British
Columbia, Canada, and found a 31 to 47 percent reduction in the ozone
concentration from the top of the canopy to the forest floor. Utiyama et al. [6]
found in a 15-m-high canopy of a red pine forest situated in central Japan that
the ozone concentration decreased by 35 percent from the top of canopy to the
forest floor in autumn, during which no ozone formation was found to occur in
the trunk space. Launiainen et al. [7] measured ozone fluxes above and within
a boreal Scots pine forest in Southern Finland, where the mean canopy height
was 15 - 16 m, and discussed ozone removal by the canopy and forest floor. Savi
et al. [8] found, in a 14-m-high evergreen Holm oak forest located within the
Castelporziano Estate, Italy, that the forest canopy was a net sink of ozone.</p>

<p class="body"> It is important to accumulate
observation data at various forest sites while considering vegetation and
meteorological conditions. In this study, as part of a comprehensive study on
the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature focusing on woodland, we
measured the distributions of the nitrogen dioxide (NO<sub>2</sub>)
concentration inside and outside the Ryukoku forest located at Seta Hill in
Shiga Prefecture, Japan. Ozone is sometimes photochemically formed in the trunk
space owing to the emission of hydrocarbons from trees [6]. Since NO<sub>2</sub>
is much less reactive than ozone, the observation of NO<sub>2</sub> is useful
for studying removal mechanism of air pollutants in forests.</p>

<p class="body"> There are two mechanisms by
which forest air is purified: the deposition of air pollutants onto leaf
surfaces and the effect of a tree wind break (air pollutant break). A wind
tunnel experiment to determine the effect of the canopy layer on flow
turbulence was conducted by Pietri et al. [9]. They used conical model trees
made of metal and fine green foam, and quantitatively obtained the wind break
effect in the case where the ratios of the tree spacing to tree height were 1,
1.5 and 2. Gromke et al. [10, 11] investigated the effect of trees on the
dispersion of pollutants by means of a wind tunnel experiment and a
computational fluid dynamics simulation. They placed one or two rows of a
fibrous wadding material in street canyon models to simulate avenues of trees.
A tracer gas was emitted in the street canyon or between the model trees. Al-Dabbous et al. [12] conducted
field measurements to investigate the influence of roadside vegetation barriers
on the movement of air pollutants. Janh&auml;ll [13] reviewed the influence of urban vegetation
on the deposition and dispersion of air pollutants and introduced some studies
on vegetation barriers in street canyons. However,
no studies on the effect of trees on the dispersion of air pollutants
transported from outside a forest have been reported to the best of our
knowledge. We therefore conducted wind tunnel experiments to elucidate the
effect of trees on air pollutant break. </p>

<h4>2. Field Observation</h4>

<p class="body">Seta Hill,
Shiga Prefecture, Japan, is near the Kansai metropolitan area, which includes
Osaka and Kyoto. Shiga prefecture is almost located in the centre of Japan and
Seta Hill is located at the southwest end of Shiga prefecture as shown in
Figure 1. Seta Hill includes the Ryukoku forest, a 38 ha woodland area
primarily composed of konara oak (<i>Quercus serrata</i>, deciduous), longstalk
holly (<i>Ilex pedunculosa</i>, broad-leaved evergreen), Japanese red pine (<i>Pinus
densiflora</i>, coniferous) and hinoki cypress (<i>Chamaecyparis obtusa</i>,
coniferous). The study area is the Ryukoku forest and the neighbouring Ryukoku
University campus, located 150 - 160 m above sea level at N35.0 deg., E135.9
deg., approximately 15 km east of central Kyoto. The Ryukoku forest and the
surrounding area are also shown in Figure 1. There is a highway at a distance
of about 1 km from the university campus but no other major stationary emission
sources of air pollutants. The area surrounding the university campus can be
considered to be a typical suburb. A 25-m-tall observation tower was set up in
the forest. The tower has a fetch longer than 300 m from the nearest forest
edge. The height of the canopy top varies with the season. In this paper, the
height of the canopy top is assumed to be 15.6 m, which is the highest
observation point of NO<sub>2</sub> in the canopy layer. The leaf area index
(LAI) of the canopy at the observation tower was measured by an optical sensor
(LI-COR LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer). The LAIs estimated from measurements
made above the canopy and at ground level were 4.2 and 3.5 in autumn and winter
2013, respectively.</p>

<p class="body">NO<sub>2</sub>
was collected using an Ogawa passive sampler [14], and nitrite ions were
extracted from the filter of the passive sampler. The NO<sub>2</sub>
concentration was determined from the nitrite ion concentration analysed using
a spectrometer (Shimadzu UV2550). Two filters were placed in the body of the
passive sampler. We averaged the NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations analysed from
each filter. The difference in the NO<sub>2</sub> concentrations between the two
filters was approximately 3 percent of the average and 185 out of 193 sample
pairs showed differences within 10 percent of the average. Bytnerowicz et al.
[15] observed the distributions of ozone and nitrogen dioxide in 32 forests sites
in central Europe using passive samplers. Passive samplers have been proven to
be useful tools for determining the temporal and spatial variation when
studying the exposure of the forests to gaseous air pollution [16].</p>

observation points in the campus marked by triangles.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">Twelve
passive samplers were attached to the observation tower at heights of between
0.1 and 25.1 m. Each measurement was performed for 3 days in almost every month
from January to December 2013. Furthermore, the vertical distribution of the NO<sub>2</sub>
concentration outside the Ryukoku forest was measured at heights of between 1.5
and 30 m using passive samplers attached to university campus buildings at the locations
shown by triangles in Figure 1. Wind measurements with a vane anemometer
(Vector Instruments W200P) were performed at a height of 5 m using the
observation tower in the Ryukoku forest and at a height of 6 m using a mast in
the university campus.</p>

<h4>3. Wind Tunnel Experiments</h4>

<p class="body">Wind tunnel
experiments were conducted using facilities at the Meteorological Research
Institute of Japan Meteorological Agency. The test section of the wind tunnel
was 18 m long, 3 m wide and 2 m high. A grid and rods were placed at the
entrance to the test section and 10 mm cubes were placed at the floor of the
test section to produce a suburban atmospheric boundary layer. Experiments were
conducted with a flow velocity of 5 m/s at the boundary layer height. The
height of the boundary layer and the wind-profile power-law exponent were 280
mm and 1/7, respectively. The streamwise turbulence intensity was more than 10
percent near the surface.</p>

<p class="body">Figure 2
shows wooden model trees, 10 mm cubes and a sampling probe for tracer gas. Two
or four parallel rows of model trees at 100 mm
intervals were set up. In the case of four parallel
rows, the trunks of the trees were arranged in a staggered manner as shown in
the figure. One model tree was 10 mm wide and 12 mm thick, and comprised a
75-mm-high canopy layer and a 25-mm-high trunk space. Thirty-six holes of 6 mm
diameter were bored in the canopy layer with an opening ratio of 14 percent. A
wire gauze of 12 meshes per inch was used to simulate the canopy.</p>

<p class="body">Pure propane
was used as the tracer. The tracer gas was released parallel to the wind tunnel
floor using a gamma-type pipe of 2 mm internal diameter, collected using a
sampling probe and analysed using a flame ionisation detector (Beckman
Industrial Model 400). The sampling probe was positioned at the centre of the
model trees, as shown in Figure 2. The release point of the tracer was situated
at a distance of 2000 mm from the sampling point on the windward side. The
release heights were 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 190 mm. Measurements of the
tracer gas concentration were carried out for both flat terrain and model
trees.</p>

<p class="body">The
measurement was repeated two times for the flat terrain to examine the accuracy
of concentration measurements. The differences in the standard deviations of
lateral and vertical dispersions were 3 percent and 1 percent of the average of
the two measurements, respectively.</p>

<p class="body">The standard
deviation of lateral dispersion for flat terrain was 75 mm at a distance of
2000 mm from the release point. The total width of model trees had to be much
larger than 75 mm in order to obtain similar dispersion phenomena among the
model trees. In our wind tunnel experiment, five or six model trees per row
were set up and the total width of model trees was 500 or 600 mm. Vertical
profiles of the concentration of tracer gas are analysed with respect to the
height normalized by canopy height. It can therefore be considered that the number
and height of the model tree do not affect the interpretation of the dispersion
phenomena in this study.</p>

(lower).</figcaption>
</figure>

<p class="body">We discuss
here the influence of the opening ratio of a model tree on the dispersion
characteristics among model trees. The opening ratio is determined from various
factors such as the size of the model tree, number of holes and the diameter of
holes. The opening ratio itself is more important than each single factor. In
our study, the size of each model tree and the hole diameter were fixed. Figure
3 shows the effect of the number of holes on the vertical profiles of the
tracer gas. The number of parallel rows of model trees was two and the release
height of the tracer gas was 60 mm. The number of holes and the corresponding
opening ratio are shown in the legend. The concentration of the tracer gas
below the canopy top for 36 holes was approximately 20 - 30 percent higher than
those for zero and 6 holes. The zero hole corresponds to an impermeable canopy
layer and is unrealistics. There is a difference of 10 percent between the
results for 36 holes and 12 (or 18) holes. The model tree with 36 holes was
used in our wind tunnel experiment. Comparison between the results of the wind
tunnel experiment using model trees with 36 holes and those of the field
observation is discussed later with reference to Figure 9.</p>

<p class="body">The flow fields
were measured by laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) combining an argon laser
(Spectra Physics model 2017) and a Burst Spectrum Analyser (Dantec Dynamics
F60), and visualised by the smoke wire technique. In this technique, smoke is
generated by heating a glycerine-covered nickel-chromium wire of 0.2 mm
diameter. Since LDV measurements and smoke visualisations under the canopy
cover were very difficult, flow fields were acquired without the canopy cover.</p>

<h4>4. Results</h4>

<p class="body">Figure 4
shows the observed NO<sub>2</sub> concentration plotted against the height from
the forest floor in the Ryukoku forest. The observed NO<sub>2</sub>
concentration decreased from the top of the canopy to the forest floor throughout
the year. The average ratio of the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the forest
floor to that above the canopy top was approximately 70 percent. The decrease
in the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration in the forest is due to not only the
deposition onto leaf surfaces but also the effect of a tree wind break. Since
wind tunnel experiments cannot consider the effect of deposition, their results
show the contribution of the effect of trees on air pollutant break. </p>

<p class="body">A forest consists of the
canopy cover, canopy layer and trunk space. Figure 5 shows a wind tunnel
experimental result showing the effect of the canopy cover on the vertical
profile of the tracer gas. The number of parallel row of model trees was four
and the release heights of the tracer gas were
60 and 120 mm. The opening ratios in the cases of canopy cover and no canopy
cover were 27.9 and 100 percent, respectively. Similar results were obtained
regardless of the existence of a canopy. This is because the tracer gas mainly
flows in the spaces between trees through holes in the canopy layer and trunk
space.</p>

<p class="body">The result of
flow visualisation using the smoke-wire technique is shown in Figure 6. The
movement of smoke is sketched by the thick arrows. The thin arrows show wind
vectors around the height of the canopy top at the centreline of the model
trees. The wind velocity at the canopy height was very low and the winds at and
below the canopy height blew in opposite directions. Figure 6 shows that less
smoke flowed in the spaces between the trees through the canopy cover, although
there were instantaneous in- and outflows of smoke. Gromke et al [17] studied
the dispersion phenomena in a wind tunnel model of a street canyon and were
unable to find a substantial difference in the flow fields between impermeable
and permeable tree crowns. Hereafter we will analyse the results of wind tunnel
experiments using a canopy cover.</p>

<p class="body">The observed
vertical NO<sub>2</sub> profile outside the Ryukoku forest (i.e., at the
University campus) was almost uniform as shown in Figure 7. It is considered
that this is because exhaust gases released from various heights are
transported to the forest. The following integrated concentration was therefore
estimated from the results of the wind tunnel experiment for each release
height:</p>

<p class="body">In the wind
tunnel experiments, vertical distributions of the tracer gas concentration for
flat terrain were obtained for various release heights. A uniform distribution

was obtained by integrating the vertical concentration distributions for the
flat terrain. The values of <i>w(H)</i> in Eq. (1) were chosen so that the
uniform distribution outside the forest was obtained. The value of <i>w(H)</i>
ranged from 1 to 1.6. Similarly, Eq. (1) was used to estimate the vertical
concentration distribution of the tracer gas among the model trees. <i>w(H)</i>
for the model trees was the same as that for the flat terrain.</p>

<p class="body">The wind
tunnel experimental results for four parallel rows of model trees are shown in
Figure 8. This figure shows the vertical distribution of the tracer gas for
various release heights. An increase in the tracer gas concentration above the
canopy top and a tendency for the tracer gas concentration to be uniform below
the height of the canopy top are observable. These characteristics are due to
the upward flow that occurred on the windward side of the model trees and
strong turbulence among the model trees. Another characteristic is the
appearance of inflection points at a height of 100 mm, i.e., the canopy height,
except for the release height of 190 mm, indicating that there is little exchange
of the tracer gas throughout the canopy cover.</p>

<p class="body">The
integrated concentration of the tracer gas obtained using Eq. (1) is shown in
Figure 9. The concentration was normalised by the tracer gas concentration for
flat terrain (or outside the forest) at the height of the canopy top (<i>z<sub>top</sub></i>).
The vertical axis was normalised by <i>z<sub>top</sub></i>. The solid lines
were obtained from the observation in the Ryukoku forest, while the broken
lines were obtained from the wind tunnel experiments. In the figure, the
observed results in the Ryukoku forest show the annual average and the results
for the summer period. The results of the wind tunnel experiments for two and
four parallel rows of model trees are also included. The concentrations of the
tracer gas below the canopy top for the cases of two and four parallel rows
decreased by 5 and 30 percent, respectively, compared
with that for flat terrain. The annual average of the observed vertical NO<sub>2</sub>
profile lay between the wind tunnel experimental results for two and four
parallel rows. The wind tunnel experimental results indicated a uniform
vertical distribution in the canopy layer and trunk space, while the observed
result showed a decrease in the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration from the canopy
top to the forest floor. It is deduced that the decrease in the tracer gas
concentration among the model trees that appeared in the wind tunnel experiment
corresponds to the tree wind break effect, while the concentration gradient
appearing in the Ryukoku forest is due to the effects of the plant uptake and
deposition of air pollutants. The observed vertical NO<sub>2</sub> profile for
the summer period is similar to the wind tunnel experimental result for four
parallel rows.</p>

<p class="body">A comparison
of the wind velocity observed in the Ryukoku forest with that measured in the
wind tunnel is shown in Figure 10. The ratio of the wind velocity inside the
Ryukoku forest to that at the campus varied with the season. The result for
four parallel rows in the wind tunnel was almost coincident with the results observed
from summer to the beginning of autumn when the amount of biomass was large and
the LAI was high in the forest.</p>

<h4>5. Conclusion</h4>

<p class="body">A decrease in
the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration from the top of the canopy to the forest floor
was observed in the Ryukoku forest at Seta Hill in Shiga Prefecture, Japan. The
annual average of the ratio of the NO<sub>2</sub> concentration at the forest
floor to that at the canopy top was approximately 70 percent. Similar decreases
in the ozone concentration in the forest canopy layer have previously been
observed and discussed from the viewpoint of deposition on leaf surfaces,
uptake by vegetation and chemical destruction. The decrease in the air
pollutant concentration in forests is due to not only the deposition of air
pollutants onto leaf surfaces but also the effect of a tree wind break. Wind
tunnel experiments cannot consider the effect of deposition, and can treat
atmospheric transport and dispersion in model trees. This study dealt with the
decrease in the air pollutant concentration due to the fluid dynamic effect of
a wind break through wind tunnel experiments.</p>

<p class="body">The results
of the wind tunnel experiment for four parallel rows of model trees showed a
decrease in the concentration of air pollutants inside the forest comparable to
the observation in the Ryukoku forest. This is probably because a similar wind
break effect was found in the wind tunnel experiment and the observation.
However, the decrease in the concentration of air pollutants from the top of
the canopy to the forest floor was not observed in the wind tunnel experiment.
From the above results, it is deduced that the low NO<sub>2</sub> concentration
inside the forest compared with that outside the forest is mainly due to the
tree wind break effect and that the variation in the NO<sub>2</sub>
concentration with the height from the forest floor is mainly due to the
deposition of air pollutants onto leaf surfaces.</p>

<p class="body">Since the
wind tunnel experiments were conducted using simple model trees, the effect of
the canopy cover on the inflow of air pollutants into the forest was examined.
There were no substantial differences in the concentration distribution of the
tracer gas between the cases of model trees with and without the canopy cover.
Other configurations of model trees remain to be explored in order to simulate
the transport and dispersion of air pollutants in the Ryukoku forest in a more rigorous
manner. This will be the purpose of our future work.</p>
